# pio-doc
A Japanese translation of Raspberry Pi Pico PIO part

So far the following two documents are ongoing
* c-sdk: PIO part (Chapter 11) in c-sdk.pdf
* datasheet: PIO part in pico-datasheet.pdf

You can build them on each of the subdirectory, `c-sdk` and `datasheet`.

```
$ cd c-sdk
$ make
```

or

```
$ cd datasheet
$ make
```

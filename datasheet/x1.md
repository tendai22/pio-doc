||0x010||TXF0||Direct write access to the TX FIFO for this state machine. Each write pushes one word to the FIFO. Attempting to write to a full FIFO has no effect on the FIFO state or contents, and sets the sticky FDEBUG_TXOVER error flag for this FIFO.

||26||SC||0x0||NEXTPREV_CLKDIV_RESTART: Write 1 to restart the clock dividers of state machines in neighbouring PIO blocks, as specified by NEXT_PIO_MASK and PREV_PIO_MASK in the same write.

This is equivalent to writing 1 to the corresponding CLKDIV_RESTART bits in those PIOs' CTRL registers.

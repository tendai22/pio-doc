||||# Chapter 11. PIO

||||## 11.1. Overview

RP2350 contains 3 identical PIO blocks. Each PIO block has dedicated connections to the bus fabric, GPIO and interrupt controller. The diagram for a single PIO block is shown below in Figure 43.

||||<figure>
||||<img src="img/fig43.png">
||||<figcaption>

Figure 43. PIO block-level diagram. There are three PIO blocks, each containing four state machines. The four state machines simultaneously execute programs from shared instruction memory.

FIFO data queues buffer data transferred between PIO and the system. GPIO mapping logic allows each state machine to observe and manipulate up to 32 GPIOs.

The programmable input/output block (PIO) is a versatile hardware interface. It can support a variety of IO standards, including:

||||* 8080 and 6800 parallel bus
||||* I2C
||||* 3-pin I2S
||||* SDIO
||||* SPI, DSPI, QSPI
||||* UART
||||* DPI or VGA (via resistor DAC)

PIO is programmable in the same sense as a processor. There are three PIO blocks with four state machines. Each can independently execute sequential programs to manipulate GPIOs and transfer data. Unlike a general purpose processor, PIO state machines are specialised for IO, with a focus on determinism, precise timing, and close integration with fixed- function hardware. Each state machine is equipped with:

||||* Two 32-bit shift registers (either direction, any shift count)
||||* Two 32-bit scratch registers
||||* 4 × 32-bit bus FIFO in each direction (TX/RX), reconfigurable as 8 × 32 in a single direction
||||* Fractional clock divider (16 integer, 8 fractional bits)
||||----------
||||* Flexible GPIO mapping
||||* DMA interface (sustained throughput up to 1 word per clock from system DMA)
||||* IRQ flag set/clear/status

Each state machine, along with its supporting hardware, occupies approximately the same silicon area as a standard serial  interface  block,  such  as  an  SPI  or  I2C  controller.  However,  PIO  state  machines  can  be  configured  and reconfigured dynamically to implement numerous different interfaces.

Making  state  machines  programmable  in  a  software-like  manner,  rather  than  a  fully  configurable  logic  fabric  like  a complex programmable logic device (CPLD), allows more hardware interfaces to be offered in the same cost and power envelope. This also presents a more familiar programming model, and simpler tool flow, to those who wish to exploit PIO's full flexibility by programming it directly, rather than using a pre-made interface from the PIO library.

PIO  is  performant  as  well  as  flexible,  thanks  to  a  carefully  selected  set  of  fixed-function  hardware  inside  each  state machine.  When  outputting  DPI,  PIO  can  sustain  360  Mb/s  during  the  active  scanline  period  when  running  from  a 48 MHz system clock. In this example, one state machine handles frame/scanline timing and generates the pixel clock.  Another handles the pixel data and unpacks run-length-encoded scanlines.

State machines' inputs and outputs are mapped to up to 32 GPIOs (limited to 30 GPIOs for RP2350). All state machines have independent, simultaneous access to any GPIO. For example, the standard UART code allows TX, RX, CTS and RTS to be any four arbitrary GPIOs, and I2C permits the same for SDA and SCL. The amount of freedom available depends on how exactly  a  given  PIO  program  chooses  to  use  PIO's  pin  mapping  resources,  but  at  the  minimum,  an  interface  can  be freely shifted up or down by some number of GPIOs.

||||### 11.1.1. Changes from RP2040

RP2350 adds the following new registers and controls:

||||* DBG_CFGINFO.VERSION indicates the PIO version, to allow PIO feature detection at runtime.
||||  + This 4-bit field was reserved-0 on RP2040 (indicating version 0), and reads as 1 on RP2350.
||||* GPIOBASE adds support for more than 32 GPIOs per PIO block.
||||  + Each PIO block is still limited to 32 GPIOs at a time, but GPIOBASE selects which 32.
||||* CTRL.NEXT_PIO_MASK and CTRL.PREV_PIO_MASK apply some CTRL register operations to state machines in neighbouring PIO blocks simultaneously.
||||  + CTRL.NEXTPREV_SM_DISABLE stops PIO state machines in multiple PIO blocks simultaneously.
||||  + CTRL.NEXTPREV_SM_ENABLE starts PIO state machines in multiple PIO blocks simultaneously.
||||  + CTRL.NEXTPREV_CLKDIV_RESTART synchronises the clock dividers of PIO state machines in multiple PIO blocks
||||* SM0_SHIFTCTRL.IN_COUNT masks unneeded IN-mapped pins to zero.
||||  + This is useful for MOV x, PINS instructions, which previously always returned a full rotated 32-bit value.
||||* IRQ0_INTE and IRQ1_INTE now expose all eight SM IRQ flags to system-level interrupts (not just the lower four).
||||* Registers starting from RXF0_PUTGET0 expose each RX FIFO's internal storage registers for random read or write access from the system,
||||  + The new FJOIN_RX_PUT FIFO join mode enables random writes from the state machine, and random reads from the system (for implementing status registers).
||||  + The new FJOIN_RX_GET FIFO join mode enables random reads from the state machine, and random writes from the system (for implementing control registers).
||||  + Setting both FJOIN_RX_PUT and FJOIN_RX_GET enables random read and write access from the state machine, but disables system access.

RP2350 adds the following new instruction features:

||||* Adds PINCTRL_JMP_PIN as a source for the WAIT instruction, plus an offset in the range 0-3.
||||  + This gives WAIT pin arguments a per-SM mapping that is independent of the IN-mapped pins.
||||* Adds PINDIRS as a destination for MOV.
||||  + This allows changing the direction of all OUT-mapped pins with a single instruction: MOV PINDIRS, NULL or MOV PINDIRS, ~NULL
||||* Adds SM IRQ flags as a source for MOV x, STATUS
||||  + This allows branching (as well as blocking) on the assertion of SM IRQ flags.
||||* Extends IRQ instruction encoding to allow state machines to set, clear and observe IRQ flags from different PIO blocks.
||||  + There is no delay penalty for cross-PIO IRQ flags: an IRQ on one state machine is observable to all state machines on the next cycle.
||||* Adds the FJOIN_RX_GET FIFO mode.
||||  + A new MOV encoding reads any of the four RX FIFO storage registers into OSR.
||||  + This instruction permits random reads of the four FIFO entries, indexed either by instruction bits or the Y scratch register.
||||* Adds the FJOIN_RX_PUT FIFO mode.
||||  + A new MOV encoding writes the ISR into any of the four RX FIFO storage registers.
||||  + The registers are indexed either by instruction bits or the Y scratch register.

RP2350 adds the following security features:

||||* Limits Non-secure PIOs (set to via ACCESSCTRL) to observation of only Non-secure GPIOs. Attempting to read a Secure GPIO returns a 0.
||||* Disables cross-PIO functionality (IRQs, CTRL_NEXTPREV operations) between Non-secure PIO blocks (those which permit Non-secure access according to ACCESSCTRL) and Secure-only blocks (those which do not).

RP2350 includes the following general improvements:

||||* Increased the number of PIO blocks from two to three (8 → 12 state machines).
||||* Improved GPIO input/output delay and skew.
||||* Reduced DMA request (DREQ) latency by one cycle vs RP2040.

||||## 11.2. Programmer's Model

The four state machines execute from shared instruction memory. System software loads programs into this memory, configures  the  state  machines  and  IO  mapping,  and  then  sets  the  state  machines  running.  PIO  programs  come  from various  sources:  assembled  directly  by  the  user,  drawn  from  the  PIO  library,  or  generated  programmatically  by  user software.

From this point on, state machines are generally autonomous, and system software interacts through DMA, interrupts and  control  registers,  as  with  other  peripherals  on  RP2350.  For  more  complex  interfaces,  PIO  provides  a  small  but flexible set of primitives which allow system software to be more hands-on with state machine control flow.

Figure 44. State machine overview.  Data flows in and out through a pair of FIFOs. The state machine executes a program which transfers data between these FIFOs, a set of internal registers, and the pins.  The clock divider can reduce the state machine's execution speed by a constant factor.

||||### 11.2.1. PIO Programs

PIO state machines execute short binary programs.

Programs  for  common  interfaces,  such  as  UART,  SPI,  or  I2C,  are  available  in  the  PIO  library.  In  many  cases,  it  is  not necessary to write PIO programs. However, the PIO is much more flexible when programmed directly, supporting a wide variety of interfaces which may not have been foreseen by its designers.

The PIO has a total of nine instructions: JMP, WAIT, IN, OUT, PUSH, PULL, MOV, IRQ, and SET. For more information about these instructions, see Section 11.4.

Though  the  PIO  only  has  a  total  of  nine  instructions,  it  would  be  difficult  to  edit  PIO  program  binaries  by  hand.  PIO assembly  is  a  textual  format,  describing  a  PIO  program,  where  each  command  corresponds  to  one  instruction  in  the output binary. The following code snippet contains an example program written in in PIO assembly:

Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/squarewave/squarewave.pio Lines 8 - 13

<codeblock>
|||| 8 .program squarewave
|||| 9     set pindirs, 1   ; Set pin to output
||||10 again:
||||11     set pins, 1 [1]  ; Drive pin high and then delay for one cycle
||||12     set pins, 0      ; Drive pin low
||||13     jmp again        ; Set PC to label `again`
</codeblock>

The PIO assembler is included with the SDK, and is called pioasm. This program processes a PIO assembly input text file, which  may  contain  multiple  programs,  and  writes  out  the  assembled  programs  ready  for  use.  For  the  SDK,  these assembled programs are emitted as C headers, containing constant arrays.

For more information, see Section 11.3.

||||### 11.2.2. Control Flow

On every system clock cycle, each state machine fetches, decodes and executes one instruction. Each instruction takes precisely one cycle, unless it explicitly stalls (such as the WAIT instruction). Instructions may insert a delay of up to 31 cycles before the next instruction execute, to help write cycle-exact programs.

The program counter, or PC, points to the location in the instruction memory being executed on this cycle. Generally, PC increments by one each cycle, wrapping at the end of the instruction memory. Jump instructions are an exception and explicitly provide the next value that PC will take.

Our example assembly program (listed as .program squarewave above) shows both of these concepts in practice. It drives a 50/50 duty cycle square wave with a period of four cycles onto a GPIO. Using some other features (e.g. side-set) this can be made as low as two cycles.

===== NOTE Side-set  is  where  a  state  machine  drives  a  small  number  of  GPIOs  in  addition  to  the  main  side  effects  of  the instruction it executes. It's described fully in Section 11.5.1.

The system has write-only access to the instruction memory, which is used to load programs. The clock divider slows the state machine's execution by a constant factor, represented as a 16.8 fixed-point fractional number. In the following example, if a clock division of 2.5 were programmed, the square wave would have a period of  cycles. This is useful for setting a precise baud rate for a serial interface, such as a UART.

Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/squarewave/squarewave.c Lines 34 - 38

<codeblock>
||||34     // Load the assembled program directly into the PIO's instruction memory.
||||35     // Each PIO instance has a 32-slot instruction memory, which all 4 state
||||36     // machines can see. The system has write-only access.
||||37     for (uint i = 0; i < count_of(squarewave_program_instructions); ++i)
||||38         pio->instr_mem[i] = squarewave_program_instructions[i];
</codeblock>

The following code fragments are part of a complete code example which drives a 12.5 MHz square wave out of GPIO 0 (or  any  other  pins  we  might  choose  to  map).  We  can  also  use  pins  WAIT  PIN  instruction  to  stall  a  state  machine's execution  for  some  amount  of  time,  or  a  JMP  PIN  instruction  to  branch  on  the  state  of  a  pin,  so  control  flow  can  vary based on pin state.

Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/squarewave/squarewave.c Lines 42 - 47

<codeblock>
||||42     // Configure state machine 0 to run at sysclk/2.5. The state machines can
||||43     // run as fast as one instruction per clock cycle, but we can scale their
||||44     // speed down uniformly to meet some precise frequency target, e.g. for a
||||45     // UART baud rate. This register has 16 integer divisor bits and 8
||||46     // fractional divisor bits.
||||47     pio->sm[0].clkdiv = (uint32_t) (2.5f * (1 << 16));
</codeblock>

Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/squarewave/squarewave.c Lines 51 - 59

<codeblock>
||||51     // There are five pin mapping groups (out, in, set, side-set, jmp pin)
||||52     // which are used by different instructions or in different circumstances.
||||53     // Here we're just using SET instructions. Configure state machine 0 SETs
||||54     // to affect GPIO 0 only; then configure GPIO0 to be controlled by PIO0,
||||55     // as opposed to e.g. the processors.
||||56     pio->sm[0].pinctrl =
||||57             (1 << PIO_SM0_PINCTRL_SET_COUNT_LSB) |
||||58             (0 << PIO_SM0_PINCTRL_SET_BASE_LSB);
||||59     gpio_set_function(0, pio_get_funcsel(pio));
</codeblock>

The system can start and stop each state machine at any time, via the CTRL register. Multiple state machines can be started simultaneously, and the deterministic nature of PIO means they can stay perfectly synchronised.

Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/squarewave/squarewave.c Lines 63 - 67

<codeblock>
||||63     // Set the state machine running. The PIO CTRL register is global within a
||||64     // PIO instance, so you can start/stop multiple state machines
||||65     // simultaneously. We're using the register's hardware atomic set alias to
||||66     // make one bit high without doing a read-modify-write on the register.
||||67     hw_set_bits(&pio->ctrl, 1 << (PIO_CTRL_SM_ENABLE_LSB + 0));
</codeblock>

Most instructions are executed from instruction memory, but there are other sources which can be freely mixed:

||||* Instructions written to a special configuration register (SMx INSTR) are immediately executed, momentarily interrupting other execution. For example, a JMP instruction written to SMx INSTR causes the state machine to start executing from a different location.
||||* Instructions can be executed from a register, using the MOV EXEC instruction.
||||* Instructions can be executed from the output shifter, using the OUT EXEC instruction

The last of these is particularly versatile: instructions can be embedded in the stream of data passing through the FIFO.  The I2C example uses this to embed e.g. STOP and RESTART line conditions alongside normal data. In the case of MOV and OUT EXEC, the MOV/OUT itself executes in one cycle, and the executee on the next.

||||### 11.2.3. Registers

Each  state  machine  possesses  a  small  number  of  internal  registers.  These  hold  input  or  output  data,  and  temporary values such as loop counter variables.

||||#### 11.2.3.1. Output Shift Register (OSR)

<figure>
<img src="img/fig45.png"/>
<figcaption>
Figure 45. Output Shift Register (OSR). Data is parcelled out 1…32 bits at a time, and unused data is recycled by a bidirectional shifter.  Once empty, the OSR is reloaded from the TX FIFO.
</figcaption>
<figure>

The Output Shift Register (OSR) holds and shifts output data between the TX FIFO and the pins or other destinations, such as the scratch registers.

||||* PULL instructions: remove a 32-bit word from the TX FIFO and place into the OSR.
||||* OUT instructions shift data from the OSR to other destinations, 1…32 bits at a time.
||||* The OSR fills with zeroes as data is shifted out
||||* The state machine will automatically refill the OSR from the FIFO on an OUT instruction, once some total shift count threshold is reached, if autopull is enabled
||||* Shift direction can be left/right, configurable by the processor via configuration registers

For example, to stream data through the FIFO and output to the pins at a rate of one byte per two clocks:

<codeblock>
||||1 .program pull_example1
||||2 loop:
||||3     out pins, 8
||||4 public entry_point:
||||5     pull
||||6     out pins, 8 [1]
||||7     out pins, 8 [1]
||||8     out pins, 8
||||9     jmp loop
</codeblock>

||||### 11.2.4. Autopull

Autopull (see Section 11.5.4) allows the hardware to automatically refill the OSR in the majority of cases, with the state machine stalling if it tries to OUT from an empty OSR. This has two benefits:

||||* No instructions spent on explicitly pulling from FIFO at the right time
||||* Higher throughput: can output up to 32 bits on every single clock cycle, if the FIFO stays topped up

After configuring autopull, the above program can be simplified to the following, which behaves identically:

<codeblock>
||||1 .program pull_example2
||||2
||||3 loop:
||||4     out pins, 8
||||5 public entry_point:
||||6     jmp loop
</codeblock>

Program wrapping (Section 11.5.2) allows further simplification and, if desired, an output of 1 byte every system clock cycle.

<codeblock>
||||1 .program pull_example3
||||2
||||3 public entry_point:
||||4 .wrap_target
||||5     out pins, 8 [1]
||||6 .wrap
</codeblock>

||||#### 11.2.4.1. Input Shift Register (ISR)

<figure>
<img src="img/fig46.png"/>
<figcaption>
Figure 46. Input Shift Register (ISR). Data enters 1…32 bits at a time, and current contents is shifted left or right to make room.  Once full, contents is written to the RX FIFO.
</figcaption>

||||* IN instructions shift 1…32 bits at a time into the register.
||||* PUSH instructions write the ISR contents to the RX FIFO.
||||* The ISR is cleared to all-zeroes when pushed.
||||* The state machine will automatically push the ISR on an IN instruction, once some shift threshold is reached, if autopush is enabled.
||||* Shift direction is configurable by the processor via configuration registers

Some  peripherals,  like  UARTs,  must  shift  in  from  the  left  to  get  correct  bit  order,  since  the  wire  order  is  LSB-first;  however, the processor may expect the resulting byte to be right-aligned. This is solved by the special null input source, which allows the programmer to shift some number of zeroes into the ISR, following the data.

||||#### 11.2.4.2. Shift Counters

State machines remember how many bits, in total, have been shifted out of the OSR via OUT instructions, and into the ISR via IN instructions. This information is tracked at all times by a pair of hardware counters: the output shift counter and the input shift counter. Each is capable of holding values from 0 to 32 inclusive. With each shift operation, the relevant counter increments by the shift count, up to the maximum value of 32 (equal to the width of the shift register). The state machine can be configured to perform certain actions when a counter reaches a configurable threshold:

||||* The OSR can be automatically refilled once some number of bits have been shifted out (see Section 11.5.4).
||||* The ISR can be automatically emptied once some number of bits have been shifted in (see Section 11.5.4.
||||* PUSH or PULL instructions can be conditioned on the input or output shift counter, respectively.

On PIO reset, or the assertion of CTRL_SM_RESTART, the input shift counter is cleared to 0 (nothing yet shifted in), and the output shift counter is initialised to 32 (nothing remaining to be shifted out; fully exhausted). Some other instructions affect the shift counters:

||||* A successful PULL clears the output shift counter to 0
||||* A successful PUSH clears the input shift counter to 0
||||* MOV OSR, … (i.e. any MOV instruction that writes OSR) clears the output shift counter to 0
||||* MOV ISR, … (i.e. any MOV instruction that writes ISR) clears the input shift counter to 0
||||* OUT ISR, count sets the input shift counter to count

||||#### 11.2.4.3. Scratch Registers

Each state machine has two 32-bit internal scratch registers, called X and Y.

They are used as:

||||* Source/destination for IN/OUT/SET/MOV
||||* Source for branch conditions

For example, suppose we wanted to produce a long pulse for "1" data bits, and a short pulse for "0" data bits:

<codeblock>
|||| 1 .program ws2812_led
|||| 2
|||| 3 public entry_point:
|||| 4     pull
|||| 5     set x, 23       ; Loop over 24 bits
|||| 6 bitloop:
|||| 7     set pins, 1     ; Drive pin high
|||| 8     out y, 1 [5]    ; Shift 1 bit out, and write it to y
|||| 9     jmp !y skip     ; Skip the extra delay if the bit was 0
||||10     nop [5]
||||11 skip:
||||12     set pins, 0 [5]
||||13     jmp x-- bitloop ; Jump if x nonzero, and decrement x
||||14     jmp entry_point
</codeblock>

Here X is used as a loop counter, and Y is used as a temporary variable for branching on single bits from the OSR. This program can be used to drive a WS2812 LED interface, although more compact implementations are possible (as few as 3 instructions).

MOV allows the use of the scratch registers to save/restore the shift registers if, for example, you would like to repeatedly shift out the same sequence.

===== NOTE A much more compact WS2812 example (4 instructions total) is shown in Section 11.6.2.

||||#### 11.2.4.4. FIFOs

Each state machine has a pair of 4-word deep FIFOs, one for data transfer from system to state machine (TX), and the other for state machine to system (RX). The TX FIFO is written to by system bus masters, such as a processor or DMA controller, and the RX FIFO is written to by the state machine. FIFOs decouple the timing of the PIO state machines and the system bus, allowing state machines to go for longer periods without processor intervention.

FIFOs also generate data request (DREQ) signals, which allow a system DMA controller to pace its reads/writes based on the presence of data in an RX FIFO, or space for new data in a TX FIFO. This allows a processor to set up a long transaction, potentially involving many kilobytes of data, which will proceed with no further processor intervention.

Often, a state machine only transfers data in one direction. In this case, the  SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN option can merge the two FIFOs into a single 8-entry FIFO that only goes in one direction. This is useful for high-bandwidth interfaces such as DPI.

||||### 11.2.5. Stalling

State machines may momentarily pause execution for a number of reasons:

||||* A WAIT instruction's condition is not yet met
||||* A blocking PULL when the TX FIFO is empty, or a blocking PUSH when the RX FIFO is full
||||* An IRQ WAIT instruction which has set an IRQ flag, and is waiting for it to clear
||||* An OUT instruction when autopull is enabled, and OSR has already reached its shift threshold
||||* An IN instruction when autopush is enabled, ISR reaches its shift threshold, and the RX FIFO is full

In this case, the program counter does not advance, and the state machine will continue executing this instruction on the next cycle. If the instruction specifies some number of delay cycles before the next instruction starts, these do not begin until after the stall clears.

===== NOTE Side-set  (Section  11.5.1)  is  not  affected  by  stalls,  and  always  takes  place  on  the  first  cycle  of  the  attached instruction.

||||### 11.2.6. Pin Mapping

PIO controls the output level and direction of up to 32 GPIOs, and can observe their input levels. On every system clock cycle, each state machine may do none, one, or both of the following:

||||* Change the level or direction of some GPIOs via an OUT or SET instruction, or read some GPIOs via an IN instruction
||||* Change the level or direction of some GPIOs via a side-set operation

Each  of  these  operations  uses  one  of  four  contiguous  ranges  of  GPIOs,  with  the  base  and  count  of  each  range configured  via  each  state  machine's  PINCTRL  register.  There  is  a  range  for  each  of  OUT,  SET,  IN  and  side-set  operations.  Each range can cover any of the GPIOs accessible to a given PIO block (on RP2350 this is the 30 user GPIOs), and the ranges can overlap.

For each individual GPIO output (level and direction separately), PIO considers all 8 writes that may have occurred on that cycle, and applies the write from the highest-numbered state machine. If the same state machine performs a SET /OUT  and  a  side-set  on  the  same  GPIO  simultaneously,  the  side-set  is  used.  If  no  state  machine  writes  to  this  GPIO output, its value does not change from the previous cycle.

Generally  each  state  machine's  outputs  are  mapped  to  a  distinct  group  of  GPIOs,  implementing  some  peripheral interface.

||||### 11.2.7. IRQ Flags

IRQ flags are state bits which can be set or cleared by state machines or the system. There are 8 in total: all 8 are visible to all state machines, and the lower 4 can also be masked into one of PIO's interrupt request lines, via the IRQ0_INTE and IRQ1_INTE control registers.

They have two main uses:

||||* Asserting system level interrupts from a state machine program, and optionally waiting for the interrupt to be acknowledged
||||* Synchronising execution between two state machines

State machines interact with the flags via the IRQ and WAIT instructions.

||||### 11.2.8. Interactions Between State Machines

Instruction  memory  is  implemented  as  a  1-write,  4-read  register  file,  allowing  all  four  state  machines  to  read  an instruction on the same cycle without stalling.

There are three ways to apply the multiple state machines:

||||* Pointing multiple state machines at the same program
||||* Pointing multiple state machines at different programs
||||* Using multiple state machines to run different parts of the same interface, e.g. TX and RX side of a UART, or clock/hsync and pixel data on a DPI display

State machines cannot communicate data, but they can synchronise with one another by using the IRQ flags. There are 8 flags total. Each state machine can set or clear any flag using the IRQ instruction, and can wait for a flag to go high or low using the WAIT IRQ instruction. This allows cycle-accurate synchronisation between state machines.

||||## 11.3. PIO Assembler (pioasm)

The  PIO  Assembler  parses  a  PIO  source  file  and  outputs  the  assembled  version  ready  for  inclusion  in  an  RP2350 application. This includes C and C++ applications built against the SDK, and Python programs running on the RP2350 MicroPython port.

This section briefly introduces the directives and instructions that can be used in pioasm input. For a deeper discussion of how to use pioasm, how it is integrated into the SDK build system, extended features such as code pass through, and the various output formats it can produce, see Raspberry Pi Pico-series C/C++ SDK.

||||### 11.3.1. Directives

The following directives control the assembly of PIO programs:

<description>

||.define (PUBLIC) <symbol> <value>||Define an integer symbol named <symbol> with the value <value> (see Section 11.3.2). If this .define appears before the first program in the input file, then this define is global to all programs, otherwise it is local to the program in which it occurs. If PUBLIC is specified, the symbol will be emitted into the assembled output for use by user code. For the SDK this takes the following forms:

||||* #define <program_name> <symbol> value: for program symbols
||||* #define <symbol> value: for global symbols

||.clock_div <divider>||If this directive is present, <divider> is the state machine clock divider for the program. Note, that divider is a floating point  value,  but  may  not  currently  use  arithmetic  expressions  or  defined  values.  This  directive  affects  the  default state machine configuration for a program. This directive is only valid within a program before the first instruction.

||.fifo <fifo_config>||If this directive is present, it is used to specify the FIFO configuration for the program. It affects the default state machine configuration for a program, but also restricts what instructions may be used (for example PUSH makes no sense if there is no IN FIFO configured).

This directive supports the following configuration values:

||||* txrx: 4 FIFO entries for each of TX and RX; this is the default.
||||* tx: All 8 FIFO entries for TX.
||||* rx: All 8 FIFO entries for RX.
||||* txput: 4 FIFO entries for TX, and 4 FIFO entries for mov rxfifo[index], isr aka put. This value is not supported on PIO version 0.
||||* txget: 4 FIFO entries for TX, and 4 FIFO entries for mov osr, rxfifo[index] aka get. This value is not supported on PIO version 0.
||||* putget: 4 FIFO entries for mov rxfifo[index], isr aka put, and 4 FIFO entries for mov osr, rxfifo[index] aka get.  This value is not supported on PIO version 0.

This directive is only valid within a program before the first instruction.

||.mov_status rxfifo < <n><br> .mov_status txfifo < <n><br> .mov_status irq <(next|prev)> set <n>|| This directive configures the source for the  mov  ,  STATUS. One of the three syntaxes can be used to set the status based on the RXFIFO level being below a value N, the TXFIFO level being below a value N, or an IRQ flag N being set on this PIO instance (or the next higher numbered, or lowered numbered PIO instance if next or prev or specified).  Note, that the IRQ option requires PIO version 1.

This  directive  affects  the  default  state  machine  configuration  for  a  program.  This  directive  is  only  valid  within  a program before the first instruction.

||.in <count> (left|right) (auto) (<threshold>)||If this directive is present, <count> indicates the number of IN bits to be used. 'left' or 'right' if specified, control the ISR shift direction; 'auto', if present, enables "auto-push"; <threshold>, if present, specifies the "auto-push" threshold.  This directive affects the default state machine configuration for a program.

This directive is only valid within a program before the first instruction. When assembling for PIO version 0, <count> must be 32.

||.program <name>||Start  a  new  program  with  the  name  <name>.  Note  that  that  name is  used in  code  so  should  be alphanumeric/underscore not starting with a digit. The program lasts until another .program directive or the end of the source file. PIO instructions are only allowed within a program.

||.origin <offset>||Optional directive to specify the PIO instruction memory offset at which the program must load. Most commonly this is used for programs that must load at offset 0, because they use data based JMPs with the (absolute) jmp target being stored in only a few bits. This directive is invalid outside a program.

||.out <count> (left|right) (auto) (<threshold>)||If this directive is present, <count> indicates the number of OUT bits to be used. 'left' or 'right' if specified control the OSR  shift  direction;  'auto',  if  present,  enables  "auto-pull";  <threshold>,  if  present,  specifies  the  "auto-pull"  threshold.  This  directive  affects  the  default  state  machine  configuration  for  a  program.  This  directive  is  only  valid  within  a program before the first instruction.

||.pio_version <version>||This  directive  sets  the  target  PIO  hardware  version.  The  version  for  RP2350  is  1  or  RP2350,  and  is  also  the  default version number. For backwards compatibility with RP2040, 0 or RP2040 may be used.

If  this  directive  appears  before  the  first  program  in  the  input  file,  then  this  define  is  the  default  for  all  programs,

otherwise it specifies the version for the program in which it occurs. If specified for a program, it must occur before the first instruction.

||.set <count>||If  this  directive  is  present,  <count>  indicates  the  number  of  SET  bits  to  be  used.  This  directive  affects  the  default state machine configuration for a program. This directive is only valid within a program before the first instruction.

||.side_set <count> (opt) (pindirs)||If this directive is present, <count> indicates the number of side-set bits to be used. Additionally, opt may be specified to indicate that a side <value> is optional for instructions (note this requires stealing an extra bit --- in addition to the <count>  bits --- from  those  available  for  the  instruction  delay).  Finally,  pindirs  may  be  specified  to  indicate  that  the side  set  values  should  be  applied  to  the  PINDIRs  and  not  the  PINs.  This  directive  is  only  valid  within  a  program before the first instruction.

||.wrap_target||Place  prior  to  an  instruction,  this  directive  specifies  the  instruction  where  execution  continues  due  to  program wrapping.  This  directive  is  invalid  outside  of  a  program,  may  only  be  used  once  within  a  program,  and  if  not specified defaults to the start of the program.

||.wrap||Placed after an instruction, this directive specifies the instruction after which, in normal control flow (i.e.  jmp with false  condition,  or  no  jmp),  the  program  wraps  (to  .wrap_target  instruction).  This  directive  is  invalid  outside  of  a program,  may  only  be  used  once  within  a  program,  and  if  not  specified  defaults  to  after  the  last  program instruction.

||.lang_opt <lang> <name> <option>||Specifies  an  option  for  the  program  related  to  a  particular  language  generator.  (See  Language  Generators  in Raspberry Pi Pico-series C/C++ SDK). This directive is invalid outside of a program.

||.word <value>||Stores a raw 16-bit value as an instruction in the program. This directive is invalid outside of a program.

 |(<expression>)|An expression to be evaluated; see expressions. Note that the parentheses are necessary.

||||### 11.3.3. Expressions

Expressions may be freely used within pioasm values.

||||Table 978. Expressions in pioasm i.e. <expression>

||||### 11.3.4. Comments

To create a line comment that ignores all content on a certain line following a certain symbol, use `//` or `;`.

To create a C-style block comment that ignores all content across multiple lines until after a start symbol until an end symbol appears, use `/*` to begin the comment and `*/` to end the comment.

||||### 11.3.5. Labels

Labels use the following forms at the start of a line:

```
<symbol>:
```

```
PUBLIC <symbol>:
```

===== TIP A label is really just an automatic .define with a value set to the current program instruction offset. A PUBLIC label is exposed to the user code in the same way as a PUBLIC .define.

||||### 11.3.6. Instructions

All pioasm instructions follow a common pattern:

```
<instruction> (side <side_set_value>) ([<delay_value>])
```

where:

<directive>

||<instruction>||An assembly instruction detailed in the following sections. (see Section 11.4)
||<side_set_value>||A value (see Section 11.3.2) to apply to the side_set pins at the start of the instruction. Note that the rules for a side-set value via side <side_set_value> are dependent on the .side_set (see pioasm_side_set) directive for the program. If no .side_set is specified then the side <side_set_value> is invalid, if an optional number of sideset pins is specified then side <side_set_value> may be present, and if a non-optional number of sideset pins is specified, then side <side_set_value> is required. The <side_set_value> must fit within the number of side-set bits specified in the .side_set directive.
||<delay_value>||Specifies the number of cycles to delay after the instruction completes. The delay_value is specified as a value (see Section 11.3.2), and in general is between 0 and 31 inclusive (a 5-bit value), however the number of bits is reduced when sideset is enabled via the .side_set (see pioasm_side_set) directive. If the <delay_value> is not present, then the instruction has no delay.

===== NOTE pioasm instruction names, keywords and directives are case insensitive; lower case is used in the Assembly Syntax sections below, as this is the style used in the SDK.

===== NOTE Commas appear in some Assembly Syntax sections below, but are entirely optional, e.g. out pins, 3 may be written out  pins  3, and  jmp  x--  label may be written as  jmp  x--,  label. The Assembly Syntax sections below uses the first style in each case as this is the style used in the SDK.

||||### 11.3.7. Pseudoinstructions

pioasm provides aliases for certain instructions, as a convenience:

<description>

||nop||Assembles to mov y, y. No side effect, but a useful vehicle for a side-set operation or an extra delay.

</description>

||||## 11.4. Instruction Set

||||### 11.4.1. Summary

PIO instructions are 16 bits long, and use the following encoding:

||||Table 979. PIO instruction encoding

<img src="img/Table979.png"/>

All PIO instructions execute in one clock cycle.

The function of the 5-bit Delay/side-set field depends on the state machine's SIDESET_COUNT configuration:

||||* Up to 5 LSBs (5 minus SIDESET_COUNT) encode a number of idle cycles inserted between this instruction and the next.
||||----------
||||* Up to 5 MSBs, set by SIDESET_COUNT, encode a side-set (Section 11.5.1), which can assert a constant onto some GPIOs, concurrently with main instruction execution.

||||### 11.4.2. JMP

||||#### 11.4.2.1. Encoding

<img src="img/Bit11_4_2_1.png"/>

||||#### 11.4.2.2. Operation

Set program counter to Address if Condition is true, otherwise no operation.

Delay  cycles  on  a  JMP  always  take  effect,  whether  Condition  is  true  or  false,  and  they  take  place  after  Condition  is evaluated and the program counter is updated.

||||* Condition:

||||  + 000: (no condition): Always
||||  + 000: (no condition): Always
||||  + 001: !X: scratch X zero
||||  + 010: X--: scratch X non-zero, prior to decrement
||||  + 011: !Y: scratch Y zero
||||  + 100: Y--: scratch Y non-zero, prior to decrement
||||  + 101: X!=Y: scratch X not equal scratch Y
||||  + 110: PIN: branch on input pin
||||  + 111: !OSRE: output shift register not empty

||||* Address: Instruction address to jump to. In the instruction encoding this is an absolute address within the PIO instruction memory 

JMP PIN branches on the GPIO selected by EXECCTRL_JMP_PIN, a configuration field which selects one out of the maximum of 32 GPIO inputs visible to a state machine, independently of the state machine's other input mapping. The branch is taken if the GPIO is high.

!OSRE compares the bits shifted out since the last PULL with the shift count threshold configured by SHIFTCTRL_PULL_THRESH.  This is the same threshold used by autopull (Section 11.5.4).

JMP  X--  and  JMP  Y--  always  decrement  scratch  register  X  or  Y,  respectively.  The  decrement  is  not  conditional  on  the current  value  of  the  scratch  register.  The  branch  is  conditioned  on  the  initial  value  of  the  register,  i.e.  before  the decrement took place: if the register is initially nonzero, the branch is taken.

||||#### 11.4.2.3. Assembler Syntax

```
jmp (<cond>) <target>
```

where:

<description>

||<cond>||An optional condition listed above (e.g. !x for scratch X zero). If a condition code is not specified, the branch is always taken.
||<target>||A program label or value (see Section 11.3.2) representing instruction offset within the program (the first instruction being offset 0). Because the PIO JMP instruction uses absolute addresses in the PIO instruction memory, JMPs need to be adjusted based on the program load offset at runtime. This is handled for you when loading a program with the SDK, but care should be taken when encoding JMP instructions for use by OUT EXEC.

</description>

||||### 11.4.3. WAIT

||||#### 11.4.3.1. Encoding

<img src="img/Bit11_4_3_1.png"/>

||||#### 11.4.3.2. Operation

Stall until some condition is met.

Like  all  stalling  instructions  (Section  11.2.5),  delay  cycles  begin  after  the  instruction  completes.  That  is,  if  any  delay cycles are present, they do not begin counting until after the wait condition is met.

||||* Polarity:
||||  + 1: wait for a 1.
||||  + 0: wait for a 0.
||||* Source: what to wait on. Values are:
||||  + 00: GPIO: System GPIO input selected by Index. This is an absolute GPIO index, and is not affected by the state machine's input IO mapping.
||||  + 01: PIN: Input pin selected by Index. This state machine's input IO mapping is applied first, and then Index selects which of the mapped bits to wait on. In other words, the pin is selected by adding Index to the PINCTRL_IN_BASE configuration, modulo 32.
||||  + 10: IRQ: PIO IRQ flag selected by Index
||||  + 11: JMPPIN: wait on the pin indexed by the PINCTRL_JMP_PIN configuration, plus an Index in the range 0-3, all modulo 32. Other values of Index are reserved.
||||* Index: which pin or bit to check.

WAIT x IRQ behaves slightly differently from other WAIT sources:

||||* If Polarity is 1, the selected IRQ flag is cleared by the state machine upon the wait condition being met.
||||* The flag index is decoded in the same way as the IRQ index field, decoding down from the two MSBs (aligning with the IRQ instruction IdxMode field):
||||  + 00: the three LSBs are used directly to index the IRQ flags in this PIO block.
||||  + 01 (PREV), the instruction references an IRQ from the next-lower-numbered PIO in the system, wrapping to the highest-numbered PIO if this is PIO0.
||||  + 10 (REL), the state machine ID (0…3) is added to the IRQ index, by way of modulo-4 addition on the two LSBs.  For example, state machine 2 with a flag value of 0x11 will wait on flag 3, and a flag value of 0x13 will wait on flag 1. This allows multiple state machines running the same program to synchronise with each other.
||||  + 11 (NEXT), the instruction references an IRQ from the next-higher-numbered PIO in the system, wrapping to PIO0 if this is the highest-numbered PIO.

===== CAUTION WAIT 1 IRQ x should not be used with IRQ flags presented to the interrupt controller, to avoid a race condition with a system interrupt handler

||||#### 11.4.3.3. Assembler Syntax

```
wait <polarity> gpio <gpio_num>
wait <polarity> pin <pin_num> 
wait <polarity> irq <irq_num> (rel, next, prev) 
wait <polarity> jmppin (+ <pin_offset>) 
```

where:

<description>

||<polarity>||A value (see Section 11.3.2) specifying the polarity (either 0 or 1).
||<pin_num>||A value (see Section 11.3.2) specifying the input pin number (as mapped by the SM input pin mapping).
||<gpio_num>||A value (see Section 11.3.2) specifying the actual GPIO pin number.
||<irq_num> (rel)||A value (see Section 11.3.2) specifying The IRQ number to wait on (0-7). If rel is present, then the actual IRQ number used is calculating by replacing the low two bits of the IRQ number (irq_num10) with the low two bits of the sum (irq_num10 + sm_num10) where sm_num10 is the state machine number.
||<pin_offset>||A value (see Section 11.3.2) added to the jmp_pin to get the actual pin number.
</description>

||||### 11.4.4. IN

||||#### 11.4.4.1. Encoding

<img src="img/Bit11_4_4_1.png"/>

||||#### 11.4.4.2. Operation

Shift Bit count bits from Source into the Input Shift Register (ISR). Shift direction is configured for each state machine by SHIFTCTRL_IN_SHIFTDIR. Additionally, increase the input shift count by Bit count, saturating at 32.

||||* Source:
||||  + 000: PINS
||||  + 001: X (scratch register X)
||||  + 010: Y (scratch register Y)
||||  + 011: NULL (all zeroes)
||||  + 100: Reserved
||||  + 101: Reserved
||||  + 110: ISR
||||  + 111: OSR
||||* Bit count: How many bits to shift into the ISR. 1…32 bits, 32 is encoded as 00000

If  automatic  push  is  enabled,  IN  will  also  push  the  ISR  contents  to  the  RX  FIFO  if  the  push  threshold  is  reached (SHIFTCTRL_PUSH_THRESH). IN still executes in one cycle, whether an automatic push takes place or not. The state machine will stall if the RX FIFO is full when an automatic push occurs. An automatic push clears the ISR contents to all-zeroes, and clears the input shift count. See Section 11.5.4.

IN  always  uses  the  least  significant  Bit  count  bits  of  the  source  data.  For  example,  if  PINCTRL_IN_BASE  is  set  to  5,  the instruction IN PINS, 3 will take the values of pins 5, 6 and 7, and shift these into the ISR. First the ISR is shifted to the left or right to make room for the new input data, then the input data is copied into the gap this leaves. The bit order of the input data is not dependent on the shift direction.

NULL  can  be  used  for  shifting  the  ISR's  contents.  For  example,  UARTs  receive  the  LSB  first,  so  must  shift  to  the  right.  After 8 IN PINS, 1 instructions, the input serial data will occupy bits 31…24 of the ISR. An IN NULL, 24 instruction will shift in 24 zero bits, aligning the input data at ISR bits 7…0. Alternatively, the processor or DMA could perform a byte read from FIFO address + 3, which would take bits 31…24 of the FIFO contents.

||||#### 11.4.4.3. Assembler Syntax

```
in <source>, <bit_count> 
```

where:

<desciption>

||<source>||One of the sources specified above.
||<bit_count>||A value (see Section 11.3.2) specifying the number of bits to shift (valid range 1-32).
</description>

||||### 11.4.5. OUT

||||#### 11.4.5.1. Encoding

<img src="img/Bit11_4_5_1.png"/>

||||#### 11.4.5.2. Operation

Shift Bit count bits out of the Output Shift Register (OSR), and write those bits to Destination. Additionally, increase the output shift count by Bit count, saturating at 32.

||||* Destination:
||||  + 000: PINS
||||  + 001: X (scratch register X)
||||  + 010: Y (scratch register Y)
||||  + 011: NULL (discard data)
||||  + 100: PINDIRS
||||  + 101: PC
||||  + 110: ISR (also sets ISR shift counter to Bit count)
||||  + 111: EXEC (Execute OSR shift data as instruction)
||||* Bit count: how many bits to shift out of the OSR. 1…32 bits, 32 is encoded as 00000

A 32-bit value is written to Destination: the lower Bit count bits come from the OSR, and the remainder are zeroes. This value  is  the  least  significant  Bit  count  bits  of  the  OSR  if  SHIFTCTRL_OUT_SHIFTDIR  is  to  the  right,  otherwise  it  is  the  most significant bits.

PINS and PINDIRS use the OUT pin mapping, as described in Section 11.5.6.

If automatic pull is enabled, the OSR is automatically refilled from the TX FIFO if the pull threshold, SHIFTCTRL_PULL_THRESH, is reached. The output shift count is simultaneously cleared to 0. In this case, the OUT will stall if the TX FIFO is empty, but otherwise still executes in one cycle. The specifics are given in Section 11.5.4.

OUT EXEC allows instructions to be included inline in the FIFO datastream. The OUT itself executes on one cycle, and the instruction from the OSR is executed on the next cycle. There are no restrictions on the types of instructions which can be executed by this mechanism. Delay cycles on the initial OUT are ignored, but the executee may insert delay cycles as normal.

OUT PC behaves as an unconditional jump to an address shifted out from the OSR.

||||#### 11.4.5.3. Assembler Syntax

```
out <destination>, <bit_count>
```

where:

<description>

||<destination>||One of the destinations specified above.
||<bit_count>||A value (see Section 11.3.2) specifying the number of bits to shift (valid range 1-32).
</description>

||||### 11.4.6. PUSH

||||#### 11.4.6.1. Encoding

<img src="img/Bit11_4_6_1.png"/>

||||#### 11.4.6.2. Operation

Push the contents of the ISR into the RX FIFO, as a single 32-bit word. Clear ISR to all-zeroes.

||||* IfFull: If 1, do nothing unless the total input shift count has reached its threshold, SHIFTCTRL_PUSH_THRESH (the same as for autopush; see Section 11.5.4).
||||* Block: If 1, stall execution if RX FIFO is full.

PUSH  IFFULL helps to make programs more compact, like autopush. It is useful in cases where the  IN would stall at an inappropriate time if autopush were enabled, e.g. if the state machine is asserting some external control signal at this point.

The PIO assembler sets the Block bit by default. If the Block bit is not set, the PUSH does not stall on a full RX FIFO, instead continuing immediately to the next instruction. The FIFO state and contents are unchanged when this happens. The ISR is still cleared to all-zeroes, and the FDEBUG_RXSTALL flag is set (the same as a blocking PUSH or autopush to a full RX FIFO) to indicate data was lost.

===== NOTE The  operation  of  the  PUSH  instruction  is  undefined  when  SM0_SHIFTCTRL.FJOIN_RX_PUT  or  FJOIN_RX_GET  is set --- see Section 11.4.8 and Section 11.4.9 for details of the PUT and GET instruction which can be used in this state.

||||#### 11.4.6.3. Assembler Syntax

```
push (iffull) 
push (iffull) block 
push (iffull) noblock 
```

where:

<description>

||iffull||Equivalent to IfFull == 1 above. i.e. the default if this is not specified is IfFull == 0.
||block ||Equivalent to Block == 1 above. This is the default if neither block nor noblock is specified.
||noblock||Equivalent to Block == 0 above.
</description>

||||### 11.4.7. PULL

||||#### 11.4.7.1. Encoding

<img src="img/Bit11_4_7_1.png"/>

||||#### 11.4.7.2. Operation

Load a 32-bit word from the TX FIFO into the OSR.

||||* IfEmpty: If 1, do nothing unless the total output shift count has reached its threshold, SHIFTCTRL_PULL_THRESH (the same as for autopull; see Section 11.5.4).
||||* Block: If 1, stall if TX FIFO is empty. If 0, pulling from an empty FIFO copies scratch X to OSR.

Some  peripherals  (UART,  SPI,  etc.)  should  halt  when  no  data  is  available,  and  pick  it  up  as  it  comes  in;  others  (I2S) should  clock  continuously,  and  it  is  better  to  output  placeholder  or  repeated  data  than  to  stop  clocking.  This  can  be achieved with the Block parameter.

A  non-blocking  PULL  on  an  empty  FIFO  has  the  same  effect  as  MOV  OSR,  X.  The  program  can  either  preload  scratch register X with a suitable default, or execute a MOV X, OSR after each PULL NOBLOCK, so that the last valid FIFO word will be recycled until new data is available.

PULL IFEMPTY is useful if an OUT with autopull would stall in an inappropriate location when the TX FIFO is empty. IfEmpty permits some of the same program simplifications as autopull: for example, the elimination of an outer loop counter.  However, the stall occurs at a controlled point in the program.

===== NOTE When autopull is enabled, any PULL instruction is a no-op when the OSR is full, so that the PULL instruction behaves as a barrier. OUT NULL, 32 can be used to explicitly discard the OSR contents. See Section 11.5.4.2 for more detail.

||||#### 11.4.7.3. Assembler Syntax

```
pull (ifempty) 
pull (ifempty) block 
pull (ifempty) noblock
```

where:

<description>

||ifempty||Equivalent to IfEmpty == 1 above. i.e. the default if this is not specified is IfEmpty == 0.
||block||Equivalent to Block == 1 above. This is the default if neither block nor noblock is specified.
||noblock||Equivalent to Block == 0 above.
</description>

||||### 11.4.8. MOV (to RX)

||||#### 11.4.8.1. Encoding

<img src="img/Bit11_4_8_1.png"/>

||||#### 11.4.8.2. Operation

Write the ISR to a selected RX FIFO entry. The state machine can write the RX FIFO entries in any order, indexed either by the Y register, or an immediate Index in the instruction. Requires the SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN_RX_PUT configuration field to be set, otherwise its operation is undefined. The FIFO configuration can be specified for the program via the .fifo directive (see pioasm_fifo).

If  IdxI  (index  by  immediate)  is  set,  the  RX  FIFO's  registers  are  indexed  by  the  two  least-significant  bits  of  the  Index operand. Otherwise, they are indexed by the two least-significant bits of the Y register. When IdxI is clear, all non-zero values of Index are reserved encodings, and their operation is undefined.

When only SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN_RX_PUT is set (in SM0_SHIFTCTRL through SM3_SHIFTCTRL), the system can also read the RX FIFO  registers  with  random  access  via  RXF0_PUTGET0  through  RXF0_PUTGET3  (where  RXFx  indicates  which  state machine's FIFO is being accessed). In this state, the FIFO register storage is repurposed as status registers, which the state machine can update at any time and the system can read at any time. For example, a quadrature decoder program could maintain the current step count in a status register at all times, rather than pushing to the RX FIFO and potentially blocking.

When  both  SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN_RX_PUT  and  SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN_RX_GET  are  set,  the  system  can  no  longer  access  the  RX  FIFO storage registers, but the state machine can now put/get the registers in arbitrary order, allowing them to be used as additional scratch storage.

===== NOTE The RX FIFO storage registers have only a single read port and write port, and access through each port is assigned to only one of (system, state machine) at any time.

||||#### 11.4.8.3. Assembler Syntax

```
mov rxfifo[y], isr 
mov rxfifo[<index>], isr

where:

<description>
||y||The literal token "y", indicating the RX FIFO entry is indexed by the Y register.
||<index>||A value (see Section 11.3.2) specifying the RX FIFO entry to write (valid range 0-3).
</description>

||||### 11.4.9. MOV (from RX)

||||#### 11.4.9.1. Encoding

<img src="img/Bit11_4_9_1.png"/>

||||#### 11.4.9.2. Operation

Read the selected RX FIFO entry into the OSR. The PIO state machine can read the FIFO entries in any order, indexed either by the Y register, or an immediate Index in the instruction. Requires the SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN_RX_GET configuration field to be set, otherwise its operation is undefined.

If  IdxI  (index  by  immediate)  is  set,  the  RX  FIFO's  registers  are  indexed  by  the  two  least-significant  bits  of  the  Index operand. Otherwise, they are indexed by the two least-significant bits of the Y register. When IdxI is clear, all non-zero values of Index are reserved encodings, and their operation is undefined.

When  only  SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN_RX_GET  is  set,  the  system  can  also  write  the  RX  FIFO  registers  with  random  access  via RXF0_PUTGET0 through RXF0_PUTGET3 (where RXFx indicates which state machine's FIFO is being accessed). In this state, the RX FIFO register storage is repurposed as additional configuration registers, which the system can update at any time and the state machine can read at any time. For example, a UART TX program might use these registers to configure the number of data bits, or the presence of an additional stop bit.

When  both  SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN_RX_PUT  and  SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN_RX_GET  are  set,  the  system  can  no  longer  access  the  RX  FIFO storage registers, but the state machine can now put/get the registers in arbitrary order, allowing them to be used as additional scratch storage.

===== NOTE The RX FIFO storage registers have only a single read port and write port, and access through each port is assigned to only one of (system, state machine) at any time.

<img src="img/Bit11_4_10_1.png"/>

||||#### 11.4.10.2. Operation

Copy data from Source to Destination.

||||* Destination:
||||  + 000: PINS (Uses same pin mapping as OUT)
||||  + 001: X (Scratch register X)
||||  + 010: Y (Scratch register Y)
||||  + 011: PINDIRS (Uses same pin mapping as OUT)
||||  + 100: EXEC (Execute data as instruction)
||||  + 101: PC
||||  + 110: ISR (Input shift counter is reset to 0 by this operation, i.e. empty)
||||  + 111: OSR (Output shift counter is reset to 0 by this operation, i.e. full)
||||* Operation:
||||  + 00: None
||||  + 01: Invert (bitwise complement)
||||  + 10: Bit-reverse
||||  + 11: Reserved
||||* Source:
||||  + 000: PINS (Uses same pin mapping as IN)
||||  + 001: X
||||  + 010: Y
||||  + 011: NULL
||||  + 100: Reserved
||||  + 101: STATUS
||||  + 110: ISR
||||  + 111: OSR

MOV PC causes an unconditional jump. MOV EXEC has the same behaviour as OUT EXEC (Section 11.4.5), and allows register contents  to  be  executed  as  an  instruction.  The  MOV  itself  executes  in  1  cycle,  and  the  instruction  in  Source  on  the  next cycle. Delay cycles on MOV EXEC are ignored, but the executee may insert delay cycles as normal.

The  STATUS  source  has  a  value  of  all-ones  or  all-zeroes,  depending  on  some  state  machine  status  such  as  FIFO full/empty, configured by EXECCTRL_STATUS_SEL.

MOV  can  manipulate  the  transferred  data  in  limited  ways,  specified  by  the  Operation  argument.  Invert  sets  each  bit  in Destination to the logical NOT of the corresponding bit in Source, i.e. 1 bits become 0 bits, and vice versa. Bit reverse sets each bit n in Destination to bit 31 - n in Source, assuming the bits are numbered 0 to 31.

MOV dst, PINS reads pins using the IN pin mapping, masked to the number of bits specified by SHIFTCTRL_IN_COUNT. The LSB of  the  read  value  is  the  pin  indicated  by  PINCTRL_IN_BASE,  and  each  successive  bit  comes  from  a  higher-numbered  pin, wrapping after 31. Result bits greater than the width specified by SHIFTCTRL_IN_COUNT configuration are 0.

MOV PINDIRS, src is not supported on PIO version 0.

||||### 11.4.11. IRQ

||||#### 11.4.11.1. Encoding

<img src="img/Bit11_4_11_1.png"/>

||||#### 11.4.11.2. Operation

Set or clear the IRQ flag selected by Index argument.

||||* Clear: if 1, clear the flag selected by Index, instead of raising it. If Clear is set, the Wait bit has no effect.
||||* Wait: if 1, halt until the raised flag is lowered again, e.g. if a system interrupt handler has acknowledged the flag.
||||* Index: specifies an IRQ index from 0-7. This IRQ flag will be set/cleared depending on the Clear bit.
||||* IdxMode: modify the behaviour if the Index field, either modifying the index, or indexing IRQ flags from a different PIO block:
||||  + 00: the three LSBs are used directly to index the IRQ flags in this PIO block.
||||  + 01 (PREV): the instruction references an IRQ flag from the next-lower-numbered PIO in the system, wrapping to the highest-numbered PIO if this is PIO0.
||||  + 10 (REL): the state machine ID (0…3) is added to the IRQ flag index, by way of modulo-4 addition on the two LSBs. For example, state machine 2 with a flag value of '0x11' will wait on flag 3, and a flag value of '0x13' will wait on flag 1. This allows multiple state machines running the same program to synchronise with each other.
||||  + 11 (NEXT): the instruction references an IRQ flag from the next-higher-numbered PIO in the system, wrapping to PIO0 if this is the highest-numbered PIO.

All IRQ flags 0-7 can be routed out to system level interrupts, on either of the PIO's two external interrupt request lines, configured by IRQ0_INTE and IRQ1_INTE.

The  modulo  addition  mode  (REL)  allows  relative  addressing  of  'IRQ'  and  'WAIT'  instructions,  for  synchronising  state machines which are running the same program. Bit 2 (the third LSB) is unaffected by this addition.

The  NEXT/PREV  modes  can  be  used  to  synchronise  between  state  machines  in  different  PIO  blocks.  If  these  state machines'  clocks  are  divided,  their  clock  dividers  must  be  the  same,  and  must  have  been  synchronised  by  writing CTRL.NEXTPREV_CLKDIV_RESTART  in  addition  to  the  relevant  NEXT_PIO_MASK/PREV_PIO_MASK  bits.  Note  that  the cross-PIO connection is severed between PIOs with different accessibility to Non-secure code, as per ACCESSCTRL.

If Wait is set, Delay cycles do not begin until after the wait period elapses.

||||#### 11.4.12.2. Operation

Write immediate value Data to Destination.

||||* Destination:

||||  + 101: Reserved
||||  + 110: Reserved
||||  + 111: Reserved
||||* Data: 5-bit immediate value to drive to pins or register.

This can be used to assert control signals such as a clock or chip select, or to initialise loop counters. As Data is 5 bits in size, scratch registers can be SET to values from 0-31, which is sufficient for a 32-iteration loop.

The  mapping  of  SET  and  OUT  onto  pins  is  configured  independently.  They  may  be  mapped  to  distinct  locations,  for example if one pin is to be used as a clock signal, and another for data. They may also be overlapping ranges of pins: a UART transmitter might use SET to assert start and stop bits, and OUT instructions to shift out FIFO data to the same pins.

||||## 11.5. Functional Details

||||### 11.5.1. Side-set

Side-set is a feature that allows state machines to change the level or direction of up to 5 pins, concurrently with the main execution of the instruction.

One  example  where  this  is  necessary  is  a  fast  SPI  interface:  here  a  clock  transition  (toggling  1→0  or  0→1)  must  be simultaneous with a data transition, where a new data bit is shifted from the OSR to a GPIO. In this case an OUT with a side-set would achieve both of these at once.

This makes the timing of the interface more precise, reduces the overall program size (as a separate SET instruction is not needed to toggle the clock pin), and also increases the maximum frequency the SPI can run at.

Side-set also makes GPIO mapping much more flexible, as its mapping is independent from SET. The example I2C code allows  SDA  and  SCL  to  be  mapped  to  any  two  arbitrary  pins,  if  clock  stretching  is  disabled.  Normally,  SCL  toggles  to synchronise data transfer, and SDA contains the data bits being shifted out. However, some particular I2C sequences such as Start and Stop line conditions, need a fixed pattern to be driven on SDA as well as SCL. The mapping I2C uses to achieve this is:

||||* Side-set → SCL
||||* OUT → SDA
||||* SET → SDA

This lets the state machine serve the two use cases of data on SDA and clock on SCL, or fixed transitions on both SDA and SCL, while still allowing SDA and SCL to be mapped to any two GPIOs of choice.

The side-set data is encoded in the Delay/side-set field of each instruction. Any instruction can be combined with side- set, including instructions which write to the pins, such as  OUT  PINS or  SET  PINS. Side-set's pin mapping is independent from OUT and SET mappings, though it may overlap. If side-set and an OUT or SET write to the same pin simultaneously, the side-set data is used.

===== NOTE If an instruction stalls, the side-set still takes effect immediately.

<codeblock>
||||1 .program spi_tx_fast
||||2 .side_set 1
||||3
||||4 loop:
||||5     out pins, 1  side 0
||||6     jmp loop     side 1
</codeblock>

The  spi_tx_fast example shows two benefits of this: data and clock transitions can be more precisely co-aligned, and programs can be made faster overall, with an output of one bit per two system clock cycles in this case. Programs can also be made smaller.

There are four things to configure when using side-set:

||||* The number of MSBs of the Delay/side-set field to use for side-set rather than delay. This is configured by PINCTRL_SIDESET_COUNT. If this is set to 5, delay cycles are not available. If set to 0, no side-set will take place.
||||* Whether to use the most significant of these bits as an enable. Side-set takes place on instructions where the enable is high. If there is no enable bit, every instruction on that state machine will perform a side-set, if SIDESET_COUNT is nonzero. This is configured by EXECCTRL_SIDE_EN.
||||* The GPIO number to map the least-significant side-set bit to. Configured by PINCTRL_SIDESET_BASE.
||||* Whether side-set writes to GPIO levels or GPIO directions. Configured by EXECCTRL_SIDE_PINDIR

In the above example, we have only one side-set data bit, and every instruction performs a side-set, so no enable bit is required. SIDESET_COUNT would be 1, SIDE_EN would be false. SIDE_PINDIR would also be false, as we want to drive the clock high and low, not high- and low-impedance. SIDESET_BASE would select the GPIO the clock is driven from.

||||### 11.5.2. Program Wrapping

PIO  programs  often  have  an  "outer  loop":  they  perform  the  same  sequence  of  steps,  repetitively,  as  they  transfer  a stream of data between the FIFOs and the outside world. The square wave program from the introduction is a minimal example of this:

Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/squarewave/squarewave.pio Lines 8 - 13

<codeblock>
|||| 8 .program squarewave
|||| 9     set pindirs, 1   ; Set pin to output
||||10 again:
||||11     set pins, 1 [1]  ; Drive pin high and then delay for one cycle
||||12     set pins, 0      ; Drive pin low
||||13     jmp again        ; Set PC to label `again`
</codeblock>

The  main  body  of  the  program  drives  a  pin  high,  and  then  low,  producing  one  period  of  a  square  wave.  The  entire program then loops, driving a periodic output. The jump itself takes one cycle, as does each set instruction, so to keep the high and low periods of the same duration, the set pins, 1 has a single delay cycle added, which makes the state machine idle for one cycle before executing the set pins, 0 instruction. In total, each loop takes four cycles. There are two frustrations here:

||||* The JMP takes up space in the instruction memory that could be used for other programs
||||* The extra cycle taken to execute the JMP ends up halving the maximum output rate

As  the  Program  Counter  (PC)  naturally  wraps  to  0  when  incremented  past  31,  we  could  solve  the  second  of  these  by filling the entire instruction memory with a repeating pattern of set pins, 1 and set pins, 0, but this is wasteful. State machines have a hardware feature, configured via their EXECCTRL control register, which solves this common case.

Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/squarewave/squarewave_wrap.pio Lines 12 - 20

<codeblock>
||||12 .program squarewave_wrap
||||13 ; Like squarewave, but use the state machine's .wrap hardware instead of an
||||14 ; explicit jmp. This is a free (0-cycle) unconditional jump.
||||15
||||16     set pindirs, 1   ; Set pin to output
||||17 .wrap_target
||||18     set pins, 1 [1]  ; Drive pin high and then delay for one cycle
||||19     set pins, 0 [1]  ; Drive pin low and then delay for one cycle
||||20 .wrap
</codeblock>

After executing an instruction from the program memory, state machines use the following logic to update PC:

1. If the current instruction is a JMP, and the Condition is true, set PC to the Target 
2. Otherwise, if PC matches EXECCTRL_WRAP_TOP, set PC to EXECCTRL_WRAP_BOTTOM 
3. Otherwise, increment PC, or set to 0 if the current value is 31.

The  .wrap_target  and  .wrap  assembly  directives  in  pioasm  are  essentially  labels.  They  export  constants  which  can  be written to the WRAP_BOTTOM and WRAP_TOP control fields, respectively:

This is raw output from the PIO assembler, pioasm, which has created a default pio_sm_config object containing the WRAP register values from the program listing. The control register fields could also be initialised directly.

===== NOTE WRAP_BOTTOM and WRAP_TOP are absolute addresses in the PIO instruction memory. If a program is loaded at an offset, the wrap addresses must be adjusted accordingly.

The squarewave_wrap example has delay cycles inserted, so that it behaves identically to the original squarewave program.

Thanks to program wrapping, these can now be removed, so that the output toggles twice as fast, while maintaining an even balance of high and low periods.

||||### 11.5.3. FIFO Joining

By default, each state machine possesses a 4-entry FIFO in each direction: one for data transfer from system to state machine  (TX),  the  other  for  the  reverse  direction  (RX).  However,  many  applications  do  not  require  bidirectional  data transfer  between  the  system  and  an  individual  state  machine,  but  may  benefit  from  deeper  FIFOs:  in  particular,  high- bandwidth interfaces such as DPI. For these cases, SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN can merge the two 4-entry FIFOs into a single 8-entry FIFO.

<figure>
<img src="img/fig47.png"/>
<figcaption>
Figure 47. Joinable dual FIFO. A pair of four-entry FIFOs, implemented with four data registers, a 1:4 decoder and a 4:1 multiplexer. Additional multiplexing allows write data and read data to cross between the TX and RX lanes, so that all 8 entries are accessible from both ports 
</figcaption>
</figure>

Another  example  is  a  UART:  because  the  TX/CTS  and  RX/RTS  parts  a  of  a  UART  are  asynchronous,  they  are implemented  on  two  separate  state  machines.  It  would  be  wasteful  to  leave  half  of  each  state  machine's  FIFO resources idle. The ability to join the two halves into just a TX FIFO for the TX/CTS state machine, or just an RX FIFO in the case of the RX/RTS state machine, allows full utilisation. A UART equipped with an 8-deep FIFO can be left alone for twice as long between interrupts as one with only a 4-deep FIFO.

When one FIFO is increased in size (from 4 to 8), the other FIFO on that state machine is reduced to zero. For example, if joining  to  TX,  the  RX  FIFO  is  unavailable,  and  any  PUSH  instruction  will  stall.  The  RX  FIFO  will  appear  both  RXFULL  and RXEMPTY in the FSTAT register. The converse is true if joining to RX: the TX FIFO is unavailable, and the TXFULL and TXEMPTY bits for this state machine will both be set in FSTAT. Setting both FJOIN_RX and FJOIN_TX makes both FIFOs unavailable.

8 FIFO entries is sufficient for 1 word per clock through the RP2350 system DMA, provided the DMA is not slowed by contention with other masters.

===== CAUTION Changing  FJOIN  discards  any  data  present  in  the  state  machine's  FIFOs.  If  this  data  is  irreplaceable,  it  must  be drained beforehand.

||||### 11.5.4. Autopush and Autopull

With each OUT instruction, the OSR gradually empties, as data is shifted out. Once empty, it must be refilled: for example, a  PULL  transfers  one  word  of  data  from  the  TX  FIFO  to  the  OSR.  Similarly,  the  ISR  must  be  emptied  once  full.  One approach to this is a loop which performs a PULL after an appropriate amount of data has been shifted:

<codeblock>|||| 1 .program manual_pull
|||| 2 .side_set 1 opt
|||| 3
|||| 4 .wrap_target
|||| 5     set x, 2                   ; X = bit count - 2
|||| 6     pull            side 1 [1]  ; Stall here if no TX data
|||| 7 bitloop:
|||| 8     out pins, 1     side 0 [1]  ; Shift out data bit and toggle clock low
|||| 9     jmp x-- bitloop side 1 [1]  ; Loop runs 3 times
||||10     out pins, 1     side 0      ; Shift out last bit before reloading X
||||11 .wrap
</codeblock>

This program shifts out 4 bits from each FIFO word, with an accompanying bit clock, at a constant rate of 1 bit per 4 cycles. When the TX FIFO is empty, it stalls with the clock high (noting that side-set still takes place on cycles where the instruction stalls).  Figure 48 shows how a state machine would execute this program.

<figure>
<img src="img/fig48.png"/>
<figcaption>
Figure 48. Execution of manual_pull program. X is used as a loop counter. On each iteration, one data bit is shifted out, and the clock is asserted low, then high. A delay cycle on each instruction brings the total up to four cycles per iteration. After the third loop, a fourth bit is shifted out, and the state machine immediately returns to the start of the program to reload the loop counter and pull fresh data, while maintaining the 4 cycles/bit cadence.
</figcaption>
</figure>

This program has some limitations:

||||* It occupies 5 instruction slots, but only 2 of these are immediately useful (out pins, 1 set 0 and … set 1), for outputting serial data and a clock.
||||* Throughput is limited to system clock over 4, due to the extra cycles required to pull in new data, and reload the loop counter.

This is a common type of problem for PIO, so each state machine has some extra hardware to handle it. State machines keep track of the total shift count OUT of the OSR and IN to the ISR, and trigger certain actions once these counters reach a programmable threshold.
||||* On an OUT instruction which reaches or exceeds the pull threshold, the state machine can simultaneously refill the OSR from the TX FIFO, if data is available.
||||* On an IN instruction which reaches or exceeds the push threshold, the state machine can write the shift result directly to the RX FIFO, and clear the ISR.

The manual_pull example can be rewritten to take advantage of automatic pull (autopull):

<codeblock>
||||1 .program autopull
||||2 .side_set 1
||||3
||||4 .wrap_target
||||5     out pins, 1   side 0    [1]
||||6     nop           side 1    [1]
||||7 .wrap
</codeblock>

This  is  shorter  and  simpler  than  the  original,  and  can  run  twice  as  fast,  if  the  delay  cycles  are  removed,  since  the hardware  refills  the  OSR  "for  free".  Note  that  the  program  does  not  determine  the  total  number  of  bits  to  be  shifted before the next pull; the hardware automatically pulls once the programmable threshold, SHIFCTRL_PULL_THRESH, is reached, so the same program could also shift out e.g. 16 or 32 bits from each FIFO word.

Finally,  note  that  the  above  program  is  not  exactly  the  same  as  the  original,  since  it  stalls  with  the  clock  output  low, rather  than  high.  We  can  change  the  location  of  the  stall,  using  the  PULL  IFEMPTY  instruction,  which  uses  the  same configurable threshold as autopull:

<codeblock>
||||1 .program somewhat_manual_pull
||||2 .side_set 1
||||3
||||4 .wrap_target
||||5     out pins, 1   side 0    [1]
||||6     pull ifempty  side 1    [1]
||||7 .wrap
</codeblock>

Below is a complete example (PIO program, plus a C program to load and run it) which illustrates autopull and autopush both  enabled  on  the  same  state  machine.  It  programs  state  machine  0  to  loopback  data  from  the  TX  FIFO  to  the  RX FIFO, with a throughput of one word per two clocks. It also demonstrates how the state machine will stall if it tries to OUT when both the OSR and TX FIFO are empty.

||||1 .program auto_push_pull

||||3 .wrap_target

Figure 49 shows how the state machine executes the example program. Initially the OSR is empty, so the state machine stalls on the first OUT instruction. Once data is available in the TX FIFO, the state machine transfers this into the OSR. On the  next  cycle,  the  OUT  can  execute  using  the  data  in  the  OSR  (in  this  case,  transferring  this  data  to  the  X  scratch register), and the state machine simultaneously refills the OSR with fresh data from the FIFO. Since every IN instruction immediately fills the ISR, the ISR remains empty, and IN transfers data directly from scratch X to the RX FIFO.

<figure>
<img src="img/fig49.png"/>
<figcaption>
Figure 49. Execution of auto_push_pull program. The state machine stalls on an OUT until data has travelled through the TX FIFO into the OSR.  Subsequently, the OSR is refilled simultaneously with each OUT operation (due to bit count of 32), and IN data bypasses the ISR and goes straight to the RX FIFO. The state machine stalls again when the FIFO has drained, and the OSR is once again empty.
</figcaption>
</figure>

To trigger automatic push or pull at the correct time, the state machine tracks the total shift count of the ISR and OSR, using a pair of saturating 6-bit counters.

||||* At reset, or upon CTRL_SM_RESTART assertion, ISR shift counter is set to 0 (nothing shifted in), and OSR to 32 (nothing left to be shifted out)
||||* An OUT instruction increases the OSR shift counter by Bit count
||||* An IN instruction increases the ISR shift counter by Bit count
||||* A PULL instruction or autopull clears the OSR counter to 0
||||* A PUSH instruction or autopush clears the ISR counter to 0
||||* A MOV OSR, x or MOV ISR, x clears the OSR or ISR shift counter to 0, respectively
||||* A OUT ISR, n instruction sets the ISR shift counter to n

On any  OUT or  IN instruction, the state machine compares the shift counters to the values of  SHIFTCTRL_PULL_THRESH and SHIFTCTRL_PUSH_THRESH  to  decide  whether  action  is  required.  Autopull  and  autopush  are  individually  enabled  by  the SHIFTCTRL_AUTOPULL and SHIFTCTRL_AUTOPUSH fields.

||||#### 11.5.4.1. Autopush Details

Pseudocode for an IN with autopush enabled:

<codeblock>
|||| 1 isr = shift_in(isr, input())
|||| 2 isr count = saturate(isr count + in count)
|||| 3
|||| 4 if rx count >= threshold:
|||| 5     if rx fifo is full:
|||| 6         stall
|||| 7     else:
|||| 8         push(isr)
|||| 9         isr = 0
||||10         isr count = 0
</codeblock>

The hardware performs the above steps in a single machine clock cycle, unless there is a stall.

Threshold is configurable from 1 to 32.

===== IMPORTANT Autopush  must  not  be  enabled  when  SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN_RX_PUT  or  SHIFTCTRL_FJOIN_RX_PUTGET  is  set.  Its  operation  in  this state is undefined.

||||#### 11.5.4.2. Autopull Details

On non-OUT cycles, the hardware performs the equivalent of the following pseudocode:

<codeblock>
||||1 if MOV or PULL:
||||2     osr count = 0
||||3
||||4 if osr count >= threshold:
||||5     if tx fifo not empty:
||||6         osr = pull()
||||7         osr count = 0
</codeblock>

An autopull can therefore occur at any point between two OUTs, depending on when the data arrives in the FIFO.

On OUT cycles, the sequence is a little different:

<codeblock>
|||| 1 if osr count >= threshold:
|||| 2     if tx fifo not empty:
|||| 3         osr = pull()
|||| 4         osr count = 0
|||| 5     stall
|||| 6 else:
|||| 7     output(osr)
|||| 8     osr = shift(osr, out count)
|||| 9     osr count = saturate(osr count + out count)
||||10
||||11     if osr count >= threshold:
||||12         if tx fifo not empty:
||||13             osr = pull()
||||14             osr count = 0
</codeblock>

The  hardware  is  capable  of  refilling  the  OSR  simultaneously  with  shifting  out  the  last  of  the  shift  data,  as  these  two operations can proceed in parallel. However, it cannot fill an empty OSR and OUT it on the same cycle, due to the long logic path this would create.

The refill is somewhat asynchronous to your program, but an OUT behaves as a data fence, and the state machine will never OUT data which you didn't write into the FIFO.

Note that a MOV from the OSR is undefined whilst autopull is enabled; you will read either any residual data that has not been shifted out, or a fresh word from the FIFO, depending on a race against system DMA. Likewise, a MOV to the OSR may overwrite data which has just been autopulled. However, data which you MOV into the OSR will never be overwritten, since MOV updates the shift counter.

If  you  do  need  to  read  the  OSR  contents,  you  should  perform  an  explicit  PULL  of  some  kind.  The  nondeterminism described above is the cost of the hardware managing pulls automatically. When autopull is enabled, the behaviour of PULL is altered: it becomes a no-op if the OSR is full. This is to avoid a race condition against the system DMA. It behaves as a fence: either an autopull has already taken place, in which case the PULL has no effect, or the program will stall on the PULL until data becomes available in the FIFO.

PULL does not require similar behaviour, because autopush does not have the same nondeterminism.
||||----------
||||### 11.5.5. Clock Dividers

PIO  runs  off  the  system  clock,  but  this  is  too  fast  for  many  interfaces,  and  the  number  of  Delay  cycles  which  can  be inserted  is  limited.  Some  devices,  such  as  UART,  require  the  signalling  rate  to  be  precisely  controlled  and  varied,  and ideally  multiple  state  machines  can  be  varied  independently  while  running  identical  programs.  Each  state  machine  is equipped with a clock divider, for this purpose.

Rather than slowing the system clock itself, the clock divider redefines how many system clock periods are considered to be "one cycle", for execution purposes. It does this by generating a clock enable signal, which can pause and resume execution  on  a  per-system-clock-cycle  basis.  The  clock  divider  generates  clock  enable  pulses  at  regular  intervals,  so that the state machine runs at some steady pace, potentially much slower than the system clock.

Implementing  the  clock  dividers  in  this  way  allows  interfacing  between  the  state  machines  and  the  system  to  be simpler, lower-latency, and with a smaller footprint. The state machine is completely idle on cycles where clock enable is low, though the system can still access the state machine's FIFOs and change its configuration.

The  clock  dividers  are  16-bit  integer,  8-bit  fractional,  with  first-order  delta-sigma  for  the  fractional  divider.  The  clock divisor can vary between 1 and 65536, in increments of .

If the clock divisor is set to 1, the state machine runs on every cycle, i.e. full speed:

System Clock

CLKDIV_FRAC

CTRL_SM_ENABLE

Clock Enable

<codeblock>||||1
||||1
</codeblock>

</codeblock>

.0 In general, an integer clock divisor of n will cause the state machine to run 1 cycle in every n, giving an effective clock speed of .

<codeblock>||||2

</codeblock>

.0 Fractional division will maintain a steady state division rate of , where n and f are the integer and fractional fields of this state machine's CLKDIV register. It does this by selectively extending some division periods from  cycles to .

.5 For small  n, the jitter introduced by a fractional divider may be unacceptable. However, for larger values, this effect is much less apparent.

===== NOTE For  fast  asynchronous  serial,  it  is  recommended  to  use  even  divisions  or  multiples  of  1  Mbaud  where  possible, rather than the traditional multiples of 300, to avoid unnecessary jitter.

||||### 11.5.6. GPIO Mapping

Internally, PIO has a 32-bit register for the output levels of each GPIO it can drive, and another register for the output enables  (Hi/Lo-Z).  On  every  system  clock  cycle,  each  state  machine  can  write  to  some  or  all  of  the  GPIOs  in  each  of these registers.

Figure 50. State machine operation with a clock divisor of 1. Once the state machine is enabled via the CTRL register, its clock enable is asserted on every cycle.

Figure 51. Integer clock divisors yield a periodic clock enable.

The clock divider repeatedly counts down from n, and emits an enable pulse when it reaches 1.

period.
||||----------
Figure 53. The state machine has two independent output channels, one shared by OUT/SET, and another used by side- set (which can happen at any time). Three independent mappings (first GPIO, number of GPIOs) control which GPIOs OUT, SET and side-set are directed to. Input data is rotated according to which GPIO is mapped to the LSB of the IN data.

The write data and write masks for the output level and output enable registers come from the following sources:

||||* An OUT instruction writes to up to 32 bits. Depending on the instruction's Destination field, this is applied to either
pins or pindirs. The least-significant bit of OUT data is mapped to PINCTRL_OUT_BASE, and this mapping continues for PINCTRL_OUT_COUNT bits, wrapping after GPIO31.

||||* A SET instruction writes up to 5 bits. Depending on the instruction's Destination field, this is applied to either pins or

pindirs. The least-significant bit of SET data is mapped to PINCTRL_SET_BASE, and this mapping continues for PINCTRL_SET_COUNT bits, wrapping after GPIO31.

||||* A side-set operation writes up to 5 bits. Depending on the register field EXECCTRL_SIDE_PINDIR, this is applied to either

pins or pindirs. The least-significant bit of side-set data is mapped to PINCTRL_SIDESET_BASE, continuing for PINCTRL_SIDESET_COUNT pins, minus one if EXECCTRL_SIDE_EN is set.

Each  OUT/SET/side-set operation writes to a contiguous range of pins, but each of these ranges is independently sized and  positioned  in  the  32-bit  GPIO  space.  This  is  sufficiently  flexible  for  many  applications.  For  example,  if  one  state machine is implementing some interface such as an SPI on a group of pins, another state machine can run the same program, mapped to a different group of pins, and provide a second SPI interface.

On any given clock cycle, the state machine may perform an OUT or a SET, and may simultaneously perform a side-set.

The pin mapping logic generates a 32-bit write mask and write data bus for the output level and output enable registers, based on this request, and the pin mapping configuration.

If a side-set overlaps with an OUT/SET performed by that state machine on the same cycle, the side-set takes precedence in the overlapping region.

||||#### 11.5.6.1. Output Priority

Figure 54. Per-GPIO priority select of write masks from each state machine. Each GPIO considers level and direction writes from each of the four state machines, and applies the value from the highest-numbered state machine.

Each  state  machine  may  assert  an  OUT/SET  and  a  side-set  through  its  pin  mapping  hardware  on  each  cycle.  This generates 32 bits of write data and write mask for the GPIO output level and output enable registers, from each state machine.

For each GPIO, PIO collates the writes from all four state machines, and applies the write from the highest-numbered
||||----------
state machine. This occurs separately for output levels and output values --- it is possible for a state machine to change both the level and direction of the same pin on the same cycle (e.g. via simultaneous SET and side-set), or for one state machine to change a GPIO's direction while another changes that GPIO's level. If no state machine asserts a write to a GPIO's level or direction, the value does not change.

||||#### 11.5.6.2. Input Mapping

The  data  observed  by  IN  instructions  is  mapped  such  that  the  LSB  is  the  GPIO  selected  by  PINCTRL_IN_BASE,  and successively more-significant bits come from successively higher-numbered GPIOs, wrapping after 31.

In  other  words,  the  IN  bus  is  a  right-rotate  of  the  GPIO  input  values,  by  PINCTRL_IN_BASE.  If  fewer  than  32  GPIOs  are present, the PIO input is padded with zeroes up to 32 bits.

Some instructions, such as  WAIT  GPIO, use an absolute GPIO number, rather than an index into the  IN data bus. In this case, the right-rotate is not applied.

||||#### 11.5.6.3. Input Synchronisers

To protect PIO from metastabilities, each GPIO input is equipped with a standard 2-flipflop synchroniser. This adds two cycles of latency to input sampling, but the benefit is that state machines can perform an IN PINS at any point, and will see  only  a  clean  high  or  low  level,  not  some  intermediate  value  that  could  disturb  the  state  machine  circuitry.  This  is absolutely necessary for asynchronous interfaces such as UART RX.

It is possible to bypass these synchronisers, on a per-GPIO basis. This reduces input latency, but it is then up to the user to guarantee that the state machine does not sample its inputs at inappropriate times. Generally this is only possible for synchronous interfaces such as SPI. Synchronisers are bypassed by setting the corresponding bit in INPUT_SYNC_BYPASS.

===== WARNING Sampling a metastable input can lead to unpredictable state machine behaviour. This should be avoided.

||||### 11.5.7. Forced and EXEC'd Instructions

Besides the instruction memory, state machines can execute instructions from 3 other sources:

||||* MOV EXEC which executes an instruction from some register Source
||||* OUT EXEC which executes data shifted out from the OSR
||||* The SMx_INSTR control registers, to which the system can write instructions for immediate execution

</codeblock>

Here we load an example program into the state machine, which does two things:

||||* Enters an infinite loop
||||* Enters a loop which repeatedly pulls 32 bits of data from the TX FIFO, and executes the lower 16 bits as an

instruction The  C  program  sets  the  state  machine  running,  at  which  point  it  enters  the  hang  loop.  While  the  state  machine  is  still running, the C program forces in a jmp instruction, which causes the state machine to break out of the loop.

When  an  instruction  is  written  to  the  INSTR  register,  the  state  machine  immediately  decodes  and  executes  that instruction, rather than the instruction it would have fetched from the PIO's instruction memory. The program counter does not advance, so on the next cycle (assuming the instruction forced into the INSTR interface did not stall) the state machine continues to execute its current program from the point where it left off, unless the written instruction itself manipulated PC.

Delay  cycles  are  ignored  on  instructions  written  to  the  INSTR  register,  and  execute  immediately,  ignoring  the  state machine clock divider. This interface is provided for performing initial setup and effecting control flow changes, so it executes instructions in a timely manner, no matter how the state machine is configured.

Instructions written to the INSTR register are permitted to stall, in which case the state machine will latch this instruction

internally until it completes. This is signified by the EXECCTRL_EXEC_STALLED flag. This can be cleared by restarting the state
||||----------
machine, or writing a NOP to INSTR.

In the second phase of the example state machine program, the OUT EXEC instruction is used. The OUT itself occupies one execution  cycle,  and  the  instruction  which  the  OUT  executes  is  on  the  next  execution  cycle.  Note  that  one  of  the instructions we execute is also an OUT --- the state machine is only capable of executing one OUT instruction on any given cycle.

OUT  EXEC  works  by  writing  the  OUT  shift  data  to  an  internal  instruction  latch.  On  the  next  cycle,  the  state  machine remembers it must execute from this latch rather than the instruction memory, and also knows to not advance PC on this second cycle.

This program will print "12345678" when run.

===== CAUTION If an instruction written to INSTR stalls, it is stored in the same instruction latch used by OUT EXEC and MOV EXEC, and will overwrite an in-progress instruction there. If EXEC instructions are used, instructions written to INSTR must not stall.

||||## 11.6. Examples

These examples illustrate some of PIO's hardware features, by implementing common I/O interfaces.

===== TIP Raspberry  Pi  Pico-series  C/C++  SDK  has  a  comprehensive  PIO  chapter  that  begins  with  writing  and  building  your first PIO application. Later chapters walk through some programs line-by-line. Finally, it covers broader topics such as using PIO with DMA, and how PIO can integrate into your software.

pulses a number of times, transferring one bit in each direction per pulse, but always returns to its idle state. CPHA determines on which edge of the clock data is captured: 0 for leading edge, and 1 for trailing edge. The arrows in the figure show the clock edge SPI is a common serial interface with a twisty history. The following program implements full-duplex (i.e. transferring data in both directions simultaneously) SPI, with a CPHA parameter of 0.

===== NOTE These programs do not control the chip select line; chip select is often implemented as a software-controlled GPIO, due to wildly different behaviour between different SPI hardware. The full spi.pio source linked above contains some examples how PIO can implement a hardware chip select line.

A C helper function configures the state machine, connects the GPIOs, and sets the state machine running. Note that the  SPI  frame  size --- that  is,  the  number  of  bits  transferred  for  each  FIFO  record --- can  be  programmed  to  any  value from 1 to 32, without modifying the program. Once configured, the state machine is set running.

The state machine will now immediately begin to shift out any data appearing in the TX FIFO, and push received data into the RX FIFO.

||||### 11.6.2. WS2812 LEDs

Figure 56. WS2812 line format. Wide positive pulse for 1, narrow positive pulse for 0, very long negative pulse for latch enable WS2812 LEDs are driven by a proprietary pulse-width serial format, with a wide positive pulse representing a "1" bit, and narrow positive pulse a "0". Each LED has a serial input and a serial output; LEDs are connected in a chain, with each serial input connected to the previous LED's serial output.

Latch LEDs consume 24 bits of pixel data, then pass any additional input data on to their output. In this way a single serial burst can individually program the colour of each LED in a chain. A long negative pulse latches the pixel data into the LEDs.

This program shifts bits from the OSR into X, and produces a wide or narrow pulse on side-set pin 0, based on the value of each data bit. Autopull must be configured, with a threshold of 24. Software can then write 24-bit pixel values into the FIFO, and these will be serialised to a chain of WS2812 LEDs. The .pio file contains a C helper function to set this up:

</codeblock>

Because the shift is MSB-first, and our pixels aren't a power of two size (so we can't rely on the narrow write replication behaviour on RP2350 to fan out the bits for us), we need to preshift the values written to the TX FIFO.

Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/ws2812/ws2812.c Lines 43 - 45

<codeblock>||||43 static inline void put_pixel(PIO pio, uint sm, uint32_t pixel_grb) {

||||44     pio_sm_put_blocking(pio, sm, pixel_grb << 8u);
||||45 }
</codeblock>

To DMA the pixels, we could instead set the autopull threshold to 8 bits, set the DMA transfer size to 8 bits, and write a

byte  at  a  time  into  the  FIFO.  Each  pixel  would  be  3  one-byte  transfers.  Because  of  how  the  bus  fabric  and  DMA  on

RP2350  work,  each  byte  the  DMA  transfers  will  appear  replicated  four  times  when  written  to  a  32-bit  IO  register,  so

effectively your data is at both ends of the shift register, and you can shift in either direction without worry.
||||----------
===== TIP Figure 57. UART serial format. The line is high when idle. The transmitter pulls the line down for one bit period to signify the start of a serial frame (the "start bit"), and a small, fixed number of data bits follows. The line returns to the idle state for at least one bit period (the "stop bit") before the next serial frame can begin.

The WS2812 example is the subject of a tutorial in the Raspberry Pi Pico-series C/C++ SDK document, in the PIO chapter. The tutorial dissects the ws2812 program line by line, traces through how the program executes, and shows wave diagrams of the GPIO output at every point in the program.

Idle Start Data (LSB first) Stop This  program  implements  the  transmit  component  of  a  universal  asynchronous  receive/transmit  (UART)  serial peripheral. Perhaps it would be more correct to refer to this as a UAT.

Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/uart_tx/uart_tx.pio Lines 8 - 18

<codeblock>|||| 8 .program uart_tx

||||18     jmp x-- bitloop   [6]  ; Each loop iteration is 8 cycles.
</codeblock>

As written, it will:

1. Stall with the pin driven high until data appears (noting that side-set takes effect even when the state machine is stalled) 2. Assert a start bit, for 8 SM execution cycles 3. Shift out 8 data bits, each lasting for 8 cycles 4. Return to the idle line state for at least 8 cycles before asserting the next start bit If the state machine's clock divider is configured to run at 8 times the desired baud rate, this program will transmit well- formed UART serial frames, whenever data is pushed to the TX FIFO either by software or the system DMA. To extend the program to cover different frame sizes (different numbers of data bits), the set x, 7 could be replaced with mov x, y, so that the y scratch register becomes a per-SM configuration register for UART frame size.

The  .pio file in the SDK also contains this function, for configuring the pins and the state machine, once the program has been loaded into the PIO instruction memory:

The  state  machine  is  configured  to  shift  right  in  out  instructions,  because  UARTs  typically  send  data  LSB-first.  Once configured, the state machine will print any characters pushed to the TX FIFO.

The example program in the SDK will configure one PIO state machine as a UART TX peripheral, and use it to print a message on GPIO 0 at 115200 baud once per second.

This works, but it has some annoying characteristics, like repeatedly outputting  NUL characters if the line is stuck low.
||||----------
Ideally,  we  would  want  to  drop  data  that  is  not  correctly  framed  by  a  start  and  stop  bit  (and  set  some  sticky  flag  to indicate this has happened), and pause receiving when the line is stuck low for long periods. We can add these to our program, at the cost of a few more instructions.

The second example does not use autopush (Section 11.5.4), preferring instead to use an explicit  push instruction, so that  it  can  condition  the  push  on  whether  a  correct  stop  bit  is  seen.  The  .pio  file  includes  a  helper  function  which configures the state machine and connects it to a GPIO with the pull-up enabled:

To correctly receive data which is sent LSB-first, the ISR is configured to shift to the right. After shifting in 8 bits, this

unfortunately leaves our 8 data bits in bits 31:24 of the ISR, with 24 zeroes in the LSBs. One option here is an in null, 24

instruction to shuffle the ISR contents down to 7:0. Another is to read from the FIFO at an offset of 3 bytes, with an 8-bit

read, so that the processor's bus hardware (or the DMA's) picks out the relevant byte for free:

An example program shows how this UART RX program can be used to receive characters sent by one of the hardware UARTs on RP2350. A wire must be connected from GPIO4 to GPIO3 for this program to function. To make the wrangling of 3 different serial ports a little easier, this program uses core 1 to print out a string on the test UART (UART 1), and the code running on core 0 will pull out characters from the PIO state machine, and pass them along to the UART used for the  debug  console  (UART  0).  Another  approach  here  would  be  interrupt-based  IO,  using  PIO's  FIFO  IRQs.  If  the SM0_RXNEMPTY  bit  is  set  in  the  IRQ0_INTE  register,  then  PIO  will  raise  its  first  interrupt  request  line  whenever  there  is  a character in state machine 0's RX FIFO.

Starting from the label called start, this program shifts one data bit at a time into the X register, so that it can branch on the value. Depending on the outcome, it uses side-set to drive either a 1-0 or 0-1 sequence onto the chosen GPIO. This program uses autopull (Section 11.5.4.2) to automatically replenish the OSR from the TX FIFO once a certain amount of data  has  been  shifted  out,  without  interrupting  program  control  flow  or  timing.  This  feature  is  enabled  by  a  helper function in the .pio file which configures and starts the state machine:

The  main  complication  here  is  staying  aligned  to  the  input  transitions,  as  the  transmitter's  and  receiver's  clocks  may drift relative to one another. In Manchester code there is always a transition in the centre of the symbol, and based on the  initial  line  state  (high  or  low)  we  know  the  direction  of  this  transition,  so  we  can  use  a  wait  instruction  to resynchronise to the line transitions on every data bit.

This program expects the X and Y registers to be initialised with the values 1 and 0 respectively, so that a constant 1 or 0  can  be  provided  to  the  in  instruction.  The  code  that  configures  the  state  machine  initialises  these  registers  by executing some set instructions before setting the program running.

Figure 59. Differential Manchester serial line code, also known as biphase mark code (BMC). The line transitions at the start of every bit period.

The presence of a The  transmit  program  is  similar  to  the  Manchester  example:  it  repeatedly  shifts  a  bit  from  the  OSR  into  X  (relying  on autopull to refill the OSR in the background), branches, and drives a GPIO up and down based on the value of this bit.

transition in the centre The added complication is that the pattern we drive onto the pin depends not just on the value of the data bit, as with of the bit period signifies a 1 data bit, and the absence, a 0 bit. These encoding rules are the same whether the line has an initial high or low state.

vanilla Manchester encoding, but also on the state the line was left in at the end of the last bit period. This is illustrated in Figure 59, where the pattern is inverted if the line is initially high. To cope with this, there are two copies of the test- and-drive code, one for each initial line state, and these are linked together in the correct order by a sequence of jumps.

a  chosen  GPIO.  We  arbitrarily  choose  a  32-bit  frame  size  and  LSB-first  serialisation  (shift_to_right  is  true  in

sm_config_set_out_shift),  but  as  the  program  operates  on  one  bit  at  a  time,  we  could  change  this  by  reconfiguring  the

state machine.

The RX program uses the following strategy:

1. Wait until the initial transition at the start of the bit period, so we stay aligned to the transmit clock

2. Then, wait 3/4 of the configured bit period, so that we are centred on the second half-bit-period (see Figure 59)

3. Sample the line at this point to determine whether there are one or two transitions in this bit period

4. Repeat

||||### 11.6.7. I2C

Figure 60. A 1-byte I2C read transfer. In the idle state, both lines float high. The initiator drives SDA low (a Start condition), followed by 7 address bits A6-A0, and a direction bit (Read/nWrite). The target drives SDA low to acknowledge the address (ACK). Data bytes follow. The target serialises data on SDA, clocked out by SCL. Every 9th clock, the initiator pulls SDA low to acknowledge the data, except on the last byte, where it leaves the line high (NAK).

Releasing SDA whilst SCL is high is a Stop condition, returning the bus to idle.

I2C  is  an  ubiquitous  serial  bus  first  described  in  the  Dead  Sea  Scrolls,  and  later  used  by  Philips  Semiconductor.  Two wires with pullup resistors form an open-drain bus, and multiple agents address and signal one another over this bus by driving the bus lines low, or releasing them to be pulled high. It has a number of unusual attributes:

||||* SCL can be held low at any time, for any duration, by any member of the bus (not necessarily the target or initiator
of the transfer). This is known as clock stretching. The bus does not advance until all drivers release the clock.

||||* Members of the bus can be a target of one transfer and initiate other transfers (the master/slave roles are not

fixed). However this is poorly supported by most I2C hardware.

||||* SCL is not an edge-sensitive clock, rather SDA must be valid the entire time SCL is high.
||||* In spite of the transparency of SDA against SCL, transitions of SDA whilst SCL is high are used to mark beginning

and end of transfers (Start/Stop), or a new address phase within one (Restart).

The  PIO  program  listed  below  handles  serialisation,  clock  stretching,  and  checking  of  ACKs  in  the  initiator  role.  It provides a mechanism for escaping PIO instructions in the FIFO datastream, to issue Start/Stop/Restart sequences at appropriate times. Provided no unexpected NAKs are received, this can perform long sequences of I2C transfers from a DMA buffer, without processor intervention.

The IO mapping required by the I2C program is quite complex, due to the different ways that the two serial lines must be driven and sampled. One interesting feature is that state machine must drive the output enable high when the output is low, since the bus is open-drain, so the sense of the data is inverted. This could be handled in the PIO program (e.g. mov osr,  ~osr),  but  instead  we  can  use  the  IO  controls  on  RP2350  to  perform  this  inversion  in  the  GPIO  muxes,  saving  an instruction.

We  can  also  use  the  PIO  assembler  to  generate  a  table  of  instructions  for  passing  through  the  FIFO,  for Start/Stop/Restart conditions.

The example code does blocking software IO on the state machine's FIFOs, to avoid the extra complexity of setting up

the system DMA. For example, an I2C start condition is enqueued like so:

||||73 }
</codeblock>

Because I2C can go wrong at so many points, we need to be able to check the error flag asserted by the state machine, clear the halt and restart it, before asserting a Stop condition and releasing the bus.

We need some higher-level functions to pass correctly-formatted data though the FIFOs and insert Starts, Stops, NAKs and so on at the correct points. This is enough to present a similar interface to the other hardware I2Cs on RP2350.

||||### 11.6.8. PWM

Figure 61. Pulse width modulation (PWM).

The state machine outputs positive voltage pulses at regular intervals. The width of these pulses is controlled, so that the line is high for some controlled fraction of the time (the duty cycle). One use of this is to smoothly vary the brightness of an LED, by pulsing it faster than human persistence of vision.

This program repeatedly counts down to 0 with the Y register, whilst comparing the Y count to a pulse width held in the X register. The output is asserted low before counting begins, and asserted high when the value in Y reaches X. Once Y reaches 0, the process repeats, and the output is once more driven low. The fraction of time that the output is high is therefore proportional to the pulse width stored in X.

</codeblock>

Often, a PWM can be left at a particular pulse width for thousands of pulses, rather than supplying a new pulse width each time. This example highlights how a non-blocking PULL (Section 11.4.7) can achieve this: if the TX FIFO is empty, a non-blocking PULL will copy X to the OSR. After pulling, the program copies the OSR into X, so that it can be compared to the count value in Y. The net effect is that, if a new duty cycle value has not been supplied through the TX FIFO at the start of this period, the duty cycle from the previous period (which has been copied from X to OSR via the failed PULL, and then back to X via the MOV) is reused, for as many periods as necessary.

Another  useful  technique  shown  here  is  using  the  ISR  as  a  configuration  register,  if  IN  instructions  are  not  required.

System software can load an arbitrary 32-bit value into the ISR (by executing instructions directly on the state machine), and the program will copy this value into Y each time it begins counting. The ISR can be used to configure the range of PWM counting, and the state machine's clock divider controls the rate of counting.

To start modulating some pulses, we first need to map the state machine's side-set pins to the GPIO we want to output PWM on, and tell the state machine where the program is loaded in the PIO instruction memory:

Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/pwm/pwm.pio Lines 25 - 31

<codeblock>||||25 static inline void pwm_program_init(PIO pio, uint sm, uint offset, uint pin) {
||||25 static inline void pwm_program_init(PIO pio, uint sm, uint offset, uint pin) {
||||26    pio_gpio_init(pio, pin);
||||27    pio_sm_set_consecutive_pindirs(pio, sm, pin, 1, true);
||||28    pio_sm_config c = pwm_program_get_default_config(offset);
||||29    sm_config_set_sideset_pins(&c, pin);
</codeblock>

||||----------
<codeblock>||||30    pio_sm_init(pio, sm, offset, &c);
||||30    pio_sm_init(pio, sm, offset, &c);
||||31 }
</codeblock>

A little footwork is required to load the ISR with the desired counting range:

Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/pwm/pwm.c Lines 14 - 20

<codeblock>||||14 void pio_pwm_set_period(PIO pio, uint sm, uint32_t period) {
||||14 void pio_pwm_set_period(PIO pio, uint sm, uint32_t period) {
||||15     pio_sm_set_enabled(pio, sm, false);
||||16     pio_sm_put_blocking(pio, sm, period);
||||17     pio_sm_exec(pio, sm, pio_encode_pull(false, false));
||||18     pio_sm_exec(pio, sm, pio_encode_out(pio_isr, 32));
||||19     pio_sm_set_enabled(pio, sm, true);
||||20 }
</codeblock>

Once this is done, the state machine can be enabled, and PWM values written directly to its TX FIFO.

<codeblock>||||23 void pio_pwm_set_level(PIO pio, uint sm, uint32_t level) {

||||48         sleep_ms(10);
||||49     }
||||50 #endif
||||51 }
</codeblock>

If the TX FIFO is kept topped up with fresh pulse width values, this program will consume a new pulse width for each

pulse. Once the FIFO runs dry, the program will again start reusing the most recently supplied value.

||||### 11.6.9. Addition

Although not designed for computation, PIO is quite likely Turing-complete, provided a long enough piece of tape can be found. It is conjectured that it could run DOOM, given a sufficiently high clock speed.

A full 32-bit addition takes only around one minute at 125 MHz. The program pulls two numbers from the TX FIFO and pushes their sum to the RX FIFO, which is perfect for use either with the system DMA, or directly by the processor:

||||### 11.6.10. Further Examples

Raspberry  Pi  Pico-series  C/C++  SDK  has  a  PIO  chapter  which  goes  into  depth  on  some  software-centric  topics  not presented here. It includes a PIO + DMA logic analyser example that can sample every GPIO on every cycle (a bandwidth of nearly 4Gbps at 125 MHz, although this does fill up RP2350's RAM somewhat quickly).

There are also further examples in the pio/ directory in the Pico Examples repository.

Some of the more experimental example code, such as DPI and SD card support, is currently located in the Pico Extras and Pico Playground repositories. The PIO parts of these are functional, but the surrounding software stacks are still in an experimental state.

||||## 11.7. List of Registers

The PIO0 and PIO1 registers start at base addresses of  0x50200000 and  0x50300000 respectively (defined as PIO0_BASE Table 980. List of PIO registers and PIO1_BASE in SDK).

State machine IRQ flags register. Write 1 to clear. There are eight state machine IRQ flags, which can be set, cleared, and waited on by the state machines. There's no fixed association between flags and state machines --- any state machine can use any flag.

Any of the eight flags can be used for timing synchronisation between state machines, using IRQ and WAIT instructions. Any combination of the eight flags can also routed out to either of the two system-level interrupt requests, alongside FIFO status interrupts --- see e.g. IRQ0_INTE.

0x034 IRQ_FORCE Writing a 1 to each of these bits will forcibly assert the corresponding IRQ. Note this is different to the INTF register:

writing here affects PIO internal state. INTF just asserts the processor-facing IRQ signal for testing ISRs, and is not visible to the state machines.

0x038

INPUT_SYNC_BYPASS

There is a 2-flipflop synchronizer on each GPIO input, which

protects PIO logic from metastabilities. This increases input

delay, and for fast synchronous IO (e.g. SPI) these synchronizers

may need to be bypassed. Each bit in this register corresponds

to one GPIO.
0 → input is synchronized (default)
<codeblock>||||1 → synchronizer is bypassed
||||1 → synchronizer is bypassed
</codeblock>

</codeblock>

If in doubt, leave this register as all zeroes.

This allows state machines in a neighbouring PIO block to be started/stopped/clock-synced exactly simultaneously with a write to this PIO block's CTRL register.

Note that in a system with two PIOs, NEXT_PIO_MASK and PREV_PIO_MASK actually indicate the same PIO block. In this case the effects are applied cumulatively (as though the masks were OR'd together).

Neighbouring PIO blocks are disconnected (status signals tied to 0 and control signals ignored) if one block is accessible to NonSecure code, and one is not.

This allows state machines in a neighbouring PIO block to be started/stopped/clock-synced exactly simultaneously with a write to this PIO block's CTRL register.

15:12 Reserved.

11:8 CLKDIV_RESTART: Restart a state machine's clock divider from an initial phase of 0. Clock dividers are free-running, so once started, their output (including fractional jitter) is completely determined by the integer/fractional divisor configured in SMx_CLKDIV. This means that, if multiple clock dividers with the same divisor are restarted simultaneously, by writing multiple 1 bits to this field, the execution clocks of those state machines will run in precise lockstep.

Note that setting/clearing SM_ENABLE does not stop the clock divider from running, so once multiple state machines' clocks are synchronised, it is safe to disable/reenable a state machine, whilst keeping the clock dividers in sync.

Note also that CLKDIV_RESTART can be written to whilst the state machine is running, and this is useful to resynchronise clock dividers after the divisors (SMx_CLKDIV) have been changed on-the-fly.

Specifically, the following are cleared: input and output shift counters; the contents of the input shift register; the delay counter; the waiting-on-IRQ state;

any stalled instruction written to SMx_INSTR or run by OUT/MOV EXEC; any pin write left asserted due to OUT_STICKY.

The contents of the output shift register and the X/Y scratch registers are not affected.

3:0 SM_ENABLE: Enable/disable each of the four state machines by writing 1/0 to RW 0x0 each of these four bits. When disabled, a state machine will cease executing instructions, except those written directly to SMx_INSTR by the system.

Multiple bits can be set/cleared at once to run/halt multiple state machines simultaneously.

- - 4:0 IN_COUNT: Set the number of pins which are not masked to 0 when read by an RW 0x00 IN PINS, WAIT PIN or MOV x, PINS instruction.

For example, an IN_COUNT of 5 means that the 5 LSBs of the IN pin group are visible (bits 4:0), but the remaining 27 MSBs are masked to 0. A count of 32 is encoded with a field value of 0, so the default behaviour is to not perform any masking.

Note this masking is applied in addition to the masking usually performed by the IN instruction. This is mainly useful for the MOV x, PINS instruction, which otherwise has no way of masking pins.
